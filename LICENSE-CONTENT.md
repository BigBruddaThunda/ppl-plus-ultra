## What This License Covers

All **content produced within and for the PPL± system** — including:

- All workout cards in the `cards/` directory (generated and stub)
- All deck cosmograms in the `deck-cosmograms/` directory
- The exercise library (`exercise-library.md`) and all exercise descriptions
- All deck identity documents
- The publication standard (`scl-deep/publication-standard.md`)
- The Wilson voice identity specification
- Operis editions (weekly publications, historical events database)
- Art direction specifications
- All generated workout content (exercises, cues, progressions, block sequences)
- The CLAUDE.md operating instructions and generation philosophy
- Card templates and the card template V2 format

In short: everything **generated using the language**, and the editorial voice layer that shapes it.
