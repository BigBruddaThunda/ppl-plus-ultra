# Almanac Roots — System Math Primitives

The Hero's Almanac diagnostic system (the 7 Dares, 224 questions, 224 Archetypes)
contributed foundational math to PPL±. The user-facing assessment framework is
archived. The underlying math is preserved here as system-level primitives.

## What Was Preserved

- The octave scoring logic (1-8 scale) → now the system weight scale (-8 to +8)
- The 7-Order developmental ladder → now the 7 PPL± Orders
- The 4-Lens perspective framework → now 4 of the 6 Axes
- The 8-Voice tonal system → now the 8 PPL± Colors
- The Intercolumniation spacing formula → now the training frequency derivation

## What Was Transformed

- User self-assessment → system-level weight declarations
- Dare questions → system weight source rules
- Archetype grid → zip code neighborhood identity (via cosmograms)
- Character creator → exercise ledger (character built through use, not quiz)
- Progressive coordinate clarity → exercise profile growth (more data = sharper picture)

## What Was Archived

The complete Hero's Almanac v6.1 specification is archived for reference.
The Dare questions, the assessment flow, the archetype definitions, and the
scoring mathematics are preserved as architectural history. They may return
in modified form as an optional user tool in a future phase.

See: `almanac-archive.md` for the pointer to the full documentation.
