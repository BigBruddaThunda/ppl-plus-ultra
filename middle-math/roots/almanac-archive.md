# Almanac Archive — Pointer File

The Hero's Almanac v6.1 is the diagnostic system that contributed the mathematical foundation of PPL±. The full specification — including the 7 Dares, 224 questions, 224 Archetypes, scoring mathematics, character creator flow, and publication format — is preserved as architectural history.

## What the Almanac Was

The Hero's Almanac was a self-assessment and developmental diagnostic system built by Jake Berry prior to PPL±. It posed 224 questions across 7 dimensions (called Dares). Each Dare was scored on a 1–8 octave scale. The combination of 7 Dare scores produced a 7-dimensional profile that placed the user in one of 224 possible Archetypal positions.

The assessment was designed as an intake mechanism: before building a training program, understand who the person is across 7 dimensions of development. The Archetype then informed the character of the training experience.

**The 7 Dares:**
1. Physicality (body, movement, physical expression)
2. Cognition (thinking, learning, analysis)
3. Creativity (making, expressing, building)
4. Emotion (feeling, relating, vulnerability)
5. Spirituality (meaning, purpose, transcendence)
6. Society (connection, community, leadership)
7. Autonomy (will, self-direction, independence)

**The 8-Voice tonal system** (now the 8 Colors) described how each Dare could be expressed across 8 registers.

**The Ladder** (now the 7 Orders) described 7 developmental stages for each Dare.

**The octave scoring system** (now the weight system) measured each Dare's level of expression.

## Current Archive Status

The full Hero's Almanac v6.1 specification is:
- **Preserved externally** in Jake Berry's files and the original design documents
- **Not committed to this repository** in its original form
- **Available for future commitment** if desired as a reference/historical document

If the Almanac is committed to this repository, the target location would be:
`almanac-archive/hero-almanac-v6.1/` — a read-only reference directory.

## Potential Future Return

The Almanac's user-facing assessment framework (the Dare questions, the Archetype discovery, the character creator experience) may return in modified form as an optional onboarding tool in Phase 5 or later. In that form, it would function as:

- An optional first-session intake for new users who want a recommended starting zip code
- A periodic "re-assessment" trigger after major life changes (injury, return from hiatus)
- A discovery tool for users who don't know where to start

This is not a current commitment. It is noted here as an architectural possibility.

The key insight: the Almanac's user-assessment function is now replaced by the exercise ledger. Character is revealed through use over time. The ledger accumulates the data that the Almanac questionnaire tried to capture in a single session. The ledger is slower but more accurate.

## Where the Math Lives Now

| Almanac Concept | PPL± Location |
|----------------|--------------|
| Octave scale (1-8) | `middle-math/roots/octave-logic.md` |
| The 7-stage Ladder | `middle-math/roots/order-notation.md` |
| 4 Lenses (Firmitas/Utilitas/Venustas/Gravitas) | `middle-math/roots/four-layers.md` |
| 8 Voices | `scl-deep/color-context-vernacular.md`, `scl-deep/publication-standard.md` |
| Intercolumniation spacing | `scl-deep/intercolumniation.md` |
| Archetype grid → Deck identity | `deck-cosmograms/` (42 cosmogram files, currently STUB) |

The math is not lost. It is distributed across the system that grew from it.
