# Order Notation — 7 Orders as System Architecture

The 7 PPL± Orders (🐂 Foundation through 🖼 Restoration) are more than loading protocols. They are a developmental ladder, an editorial curriculum, a periodization system, and a UI density scale — all simultaneously.

This document traces the 7 Orders from their Almanac root to their multi-dimensional function in the PPL± system.

## The Almanac Root: The Developmental Ladder

The Hero's Almanac v6.1 used a 7-stage developmental framework (the "Ladder") to describe how any capacity — physical, intellectual, creative — moves from novice to integrated mastery.

```
Stage 1: Foundation — Exposure and orientation. Learning the basic movements.
Stage 2: Acquisition — First competence. Patterns beginning to stick.
Stage 3: Application — Using what you know under real conditions.
Stage 4: Mastery — Full expression. The capacity functions without effort.
Stage 5: Innovation — You can invent within the domain.
Stage 6: Teaching — You can transfer the capacity.
Stage 7: Integration — The capacity is no longer a skill. It is you.
```

The 7 PPL± Orders correspond to these stages — not one-to-one with the Almanac's 7, but with the same developmental logic: a hierarchy from orientation (🐂 Foundation) through testing (🏟 Performance) through integration (🖼 Restoration as the completion cycle).

## The 7 Orders as Simultaneous Governing Layers

### Layer 1 — Loading Protocol

The most visible function: each Order sets a hard ceiling for load, reps, rest, and difficulty. This is the law of the address. The ceiling does not bend.

| Order | Load | Reps | Rest | Max Difficulty | CNS |
|-------|------|------|------|----------------|-----|
| 🐂 | ≤65% | 8–15 | 60–90s | 2/5 | Low |
| ⛽ | 75–85% | 4–6 | 3–4 min | 4/5 | High |
| 🦋 | 65–75% | 8–12 | 60–90s | 3/5 | Moderate |
| 🏟 | 85–100%+ | 1–3 | Full | 5/5 | High |
| 🌾 | ~70% | 8–10 | 30–90s | 3/5 | Moderate |
| ⚖ | ~70% | 10–12 | 90s | 3/5 | Moderate |
| 🖼 | ≤55% | 12–15 | 60s | 2/5 | Low |

### Layer 2 — Editorial Curriculum (Operis)

The 7 Orders map to the 7 Liberal Arts (Trivium + Quadrivium), giving each day of the week a distinct intellectual character:

| Order | Day | Liberal Art | Editorial Character |
|-------|-----|-------------|---------------------|
| 🐂 | Monday | Grammar | Naming, structure, foundation |
| ⛽ | Tuesday | Logic | Causal chains, proof, evidence |
| 🦋 | Wednesday | Rhetoric | Volume, persuasion, accumulation |
| 🏟 | Thursday | Arithmetic | Measurement, quantification, test |
| 🌾 | Friday | Geometry | Space, composition, integration |
| ⚖ | Saturday | Music | Harmony, balance, correction |
| 🖼 | Sunday | Astronomy | Wholeness, cycles, long view |

### Layer 3 — UI Density and Layout

The Order's block count dictates the visual density of the workout card:

| Order | Block Count | Layout Character |
|-------|------------|----------------|
| 🐂 | 4–6 blocks | Body-forward, cue-heavy |
| ⛽ | 5–6 blocks | Dense, numbers prominent |
| 🦋 | 6–7 blocks | Most dense, volume is the point |
| 🏟 | 3–4 blocks | Maximum whitespace, test dominates |
| 🌾 | 5–6 blocks | Flow typography, blocks connected |
| ⚖ | 5–6 blocks | Precise, fine detail |
| 🖼 | 4–5 blocks | Most spacious, each block breathes |

### Layer 4 — Content Depth (Trivium/Quadrivium)

The Operis content types (from `seeds/content-types-architecture.md`) have depth levels aligned to the Trivium (🐂, ⛽, 🦋 = Grammar/Logic/Rhetoric) and Quadrivium (🏟, 🌾, ⚖, 🖼 = Arithmetic/Geometry/Music/Astronomy).

Trivium orders = introductory depth (accessible to all readers).
Quadrivium orders = advanced depth (requires prior Trivium knowledge to fully appreciate).

This creates a natural curriculum: a user who reads the Monday (🐂 Grammar) edition regularly for a year has the foundation to appreciate the Thursday (🏟 Arithmetic) edition's depth.

## The 7 Orders as Breath

The Almanac's macro-periodization framework described an annual breath rhythm: inhale (build), exhale (release), catch-breath (integrate). The 7 Orders mirror this within a week:

- **Inhale days:** 🐂 🦋 ⛽ — building capacity
- **Peak:** 🏟 — the test
- **Exhale days:** 🌾 ⚖ — integration and correction
- **Close:** 🖼 — full release, return to baseline

The weekly 7-Order cycle is a complete breath. Monday resets. Sunday closes. The system breathes every 7 days.

## Relationship to Almanac Stage 7

The Almanac's 7th stage (Integration) corresponds to 🖼 Restoration in a non-obvious way. Restoration is not the simplest stage — it is the one where the work is most invisible. The accomplished practitioner in any domain looks effortless not because they are not working, but because they have integrated the capacity. 🖼 Restoration is the stage where the body does the invisible work of consolidating what ⛽ and 🦋 built.

This is the deepest root: the system's most "passive" Order is the one that completes the developmental cycle.
