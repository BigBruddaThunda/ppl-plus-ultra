# Four Layers — Almanac Architecture Mapped to PPL± Dimensions

The Hero's Almanac v6.1 organized its diagnostic framework into four layers:
1. **Ladder** — Developmental stages (7 levels)
2. **Lenses** — Perspective frameworks (4 lenses)
3. **Voices** — Tonal registers (8 voices)
4. **Scales** — Measurement units (the octave)

These four became the four PPL± dial categories. The mapping is not metaphorical — the structural logic carried over intact.

## Layer 1 — Ladder → Orders

**Almanac:** The Ladder described 7 developmental stages for any human capacity, from initial exposure (Stage 1) to full integration (Stage 7).

**PPL±:** The 7 Orders (🐂 through 🖼) are the Ladder applied specifically to physical training. Each Order is a loading protocol AND a stage in the development of a physical capacity.

🐂 Foundation = Stage 1 (exposure and orientation).
⛽ Strength = Stage 2-3 (acquisition under load).
🦋 Hypertrophy = Stage 3-4 (application with volume).
🏟 Performance = Stage 4-5 (mastery expression / test).
🌾 Full Body = Stage 5 (synthesis).
⚖ Balance = Stage 6 (teaching yourself through correction).
🖼 Restoration = Stage 7 (integration — the work becomes invisible).

The ladder in the Almanac was a diagnostic. In PPL±, it is a training philosophy. The structure is the same.

## Layer 2 — Lenses → Axes

**Almanac:** The 4 Lenses were perspective frameworks for examining any domain:
1. **Firmitas (Structure)** — What is stable, load-bearing, foundational?
2. **Utilitas (Function)** — What is useful, practical, transferable?
3. **Venustas (Beauty)** — What is aesthetic, felt, expressed?
4. **Gravitas (Weight)** — What is challenging, testing, demanding?

**PPL±:** These four Latin concepts became four of the six Axes:
- Firmitas → 🏛 Basics (bilateral, barbell-first, stable, foundational)
- Utilitas → 🔨 Functional (unilateral, standing, athletic transfer)
- Venustas → 🌹 Aesthetic (isolation, feel, appearance)
- Gravitas → 🪐 Challenge (hardest variation, pushing limits)

The other two Axes (⌛ Time and 🐬 Partner) were added in PPL± to extend the framework to temporal and social training contexts not addressed in the Almanac's 4-Lens model. The original 4 Lenses are the philosophical roots of the 4 original Axes; the remaining 2 are native PPL± extensions.

The Vitruvian triad (Firmitas / Utilitas / Venustas — Strength / Function / Beauty) was the Almanac's structural organizing principle and is now embedded in the three foundational Axes of the exercise selection system.

## Layer 3 — Voices → Colors

**Almanac:** The 8 Voices described tonal registers for how a person expresses any capacity — from the measured, ordered voice of high Firmitas to the passionate, intense voice of high Gravitas. The 8 Voices were:
1. Order (structured, systematic)
2. Planning (methodical, deliberate)
3. Growth (steady, sustainable)
4. Eudaimonia (honest, vulnerable, genuine)
5. Passion (urgent, intense)
6. Magnificence (deep, precise, significant)
7. Play (light, exploratory, curious)
8. Connection (warm, relational, together)

**PPL±:** The 8 Colors carry these same tonal registers into the workout structure:

| Color | Almanac Voice | Tonal Character |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| ⚫ Teaching | Order | Systematic, non-negotiable, foundational |
| 🔵 Structured | Planning | Methodical, trackable, deliberate |
| 🟢 Bodyweight | Growth | Steady, sustainable, consistent |
| ⚪ Mindful | Eudaimonia | Honest, genuine, vulnerable |
| 🔴 Intense | Passion | Urgent, maximum effort, high-stakes |
| 🟣 Technical | Magnificence | Deep, significant, precise, transformative |
| 🟡 Fun | Play | Light, curious, exploratory, optional |
| 🟠 Circuit | Connection | Warm, relational, together |

The Color is not just equipment tier and session format. It is a tonal voice. The same movement done at 🔵 Structured vs. 🟡 Fun is experienced differently even if the load is identical. The Color sets the emotional register of the session.

## Layer 4 — Scales → The Weight System

**Almanac:** The Scales were the measurement layer — the octave scoring system applied to each Dare dimension. 1 to 8. The score told the user how fully expressed each dimension was.

**PPL±:** The Scales became the weight system. The 1-to-8 scale extended to -8/+8 bipolar axis. The "score" shifted from measuring a user to measuring a zip code address.

## The Transformation

```
Almanac Framework          →    PPL± Structure
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Ladder (7 stages)         →    Orders (7 loading protocols)
Lenses (4 perspectives)   →    Axes (6 exercise characters, 4 from Lenses)
Voices (8 tonal registers) →   Colors (8 equipment/format/tone zones)
Scales (octave scoring)    →   Weight System (-8 to +8 for 61 emojis)
```

What the Almanac described about human development, PPL± applies to physical training sessions. The framework is the same. The domain changed.

## What Did Not Transfer

**The Dare questions:** 224 questions scored 1–8. These do not appear in PPL±. The assessment framing — "How do you experience X?" — has been replaced by ledger data. Character is built through use, not declared through self-report.

**The Archetype grid:** 224 possible archetypal profiles from the 7-Dare × 8-Value matrix. These are preserved in the Almanac archive. They may return as an optional diagnostic tool in a future phase (potentially as an onboarding sequence), but are not active in the current system.

**The 7 Archetypes per Dare:** Each Dare had 8 archetypal positions (one per octave level). These have been replaced by the cosmogram system: each of the 42 decks has a deep identity document that serves a similar function (giving a zip code neighborhood a cultural, mythological, and character identity) without requiring the user to self-assess.
