# Octave Logic — The System Weight Primitive

The Hero's Almanac v6.1 used a 1–8 scoring scale per Dare dimension. Each of the 7 Dares was scored from 1 (underdeveloped) to 8 (fully expressed). An octave of possible values: eight distinct levels of presence.

That math is preserved here as the foundation of the SCL weight system.

## From the Almanac Octave to the System Weight Scale

**Almanac form:** 1–8, unipolar. High = strong development. Low = area for growth.

**PPL± weight form:** -8 to +8, bipolar. +8 = defining presence. 0 = neutral. -8 = hard exclusion.

The transformation: extend the 1–8 positive scale to a -8/+8 axis by centering at 0. What was a 1 (barely present) becomes a -7 or -8 (actively excluded). What was an 8 (fully expressed) becomes a +7 or +8 (defining). The neutral midpoint of the Almanac (a score of 4.5 on a 1–8 scale) becomes 0.

The math is the same. The subject changed: the Almanac scored a user. The weight system scores a zip code address.

## Why the Octave

Eight values on the positive side. Eight on the negative. One neutral center.

The octave is a natural measurement unit: enough gradations to express meaningful difference, few enough to keep meaning attached to each value. A 100-point scale loses anchoring — what does 73 mean versus 74? An octave keeps each value distinct. +5 means something different from +4, and a competent reader can feel the difference.

In the Almanac, the 7 Dares produced a 7-dimensional profile. In PPL±, the 61 emojis produce a 61-dimensional weight vector. The octave scale applies to all 61 dimensions simultaneously.

## Behavioral Anchors (repeated from weight-system-spec.md for reference)

| Positive | Behavioral Anchor | Negative | Behavioral Anchor |
|----------|------------------|----------|------------------|
| +8 | Defining. This IS the character. | -8 | Hard exclusion. Never. |
| +7 | Dominant. Cannot be missed. | -7 | Violation territory. Breaks named rules. |
| +6 | Strong. Clearly shaping. | -6 | Contradicts the address. |
| +5 | Above average. Reliable. | -5 | Excluded unless overridden. |
| +4 | Equal presence. Balanced. | -4 | Suppressed. Won't surface naturally. |
| +3 | Contributing. Part of texture. | -3 | Actively avoided. |
| +2 | Noticeable if paying attention. | -2 | Noticeably absent. |
| +1 | Background hum. Barely there. | -1 | Slightly deprioritized. |
| 0 | Neutral. Neither sounding nor muted. | | |

## The Octave as a Unit of Influence

The original Almanac insight: the octave maps naturally to musical intervals, to architectural proportions, and to training load zones. An octave spans a doubling in frequency. In training terms: doubling the rep count, halving the load, doubling the rest period — these are octave-scale shifts.

In the weight system: moving from +4 to +8 is not just "twice as important." It is the difference between "equal presence" and "defining." From suppressed (-4) to excluded (-8) is the difference between "won't surface naturally" and "never, under any circumstances."

The scale is logarithmic in its behavioral implications even if the numbers are linear. This is intentional.

## Relationship to Training Load Zones

The Almanac octave has a correspondence with training intensity zones that is not accidental:

| Octave Level | Training Zone Analog |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 8 | 1RM / maximal effort |
| 7 | 90–95% |
| 6 | 80–90% (⛽ Strength upper range) |
| 5 | 75–80% (⛽ Strength lower range) |
| 4 | 70–75% (🦋 Hypertrophy upper range) |
| 3 | 65–70% (🦋 Hypertrophy lower range) |
| 2 | 60–65% (🐂 Foundation upper range) |
| 1 | ≤60% (🐂 Foundation lower range, 🖼 Restoration zone) |

This correspondence suggests the octave was designed to span from restoration to maximum effort — the full range of training intensity. The weight system inherits this natural fit: an emoji with a +8 weight is as present as a 1RM attempt. An emoji with a +1 weight is as marginal as a very light warm-up set.
