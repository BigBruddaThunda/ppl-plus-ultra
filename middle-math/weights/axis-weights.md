# Axis Weight Declarations

Status: WORKING DRAFT — First-pass derivation from scl-directory.md rules. Weights will be refined as the system matures.

Each Axis declares: self-weight (+8 when primary), affinities (emojis it pulls positive), and suppressions (emojis it pushes negative). Source rules are cited to scl-directory.md. All 6 Axes covered.

## 🏛 Basics

**Character:** Bilateral, stable, time-tested fundamentals. Barbell classics first. Priority: Barbell > dumbbell. Bilateral > unilateral. Compound > isolation. Classic > novel.

Self: +8 when primary Axis

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⛽ Strength | +5 | "Barbell classics first." Bilateral barbell compounds are the native exercise form of ⛽ neural adaptation. scl-directory.md: "⛽ = heavy loads, low reps, force production." |
| 🏟 Performance | +4 | "Bilateral, stable" surfaces: bilateral testing is standard for strength benchmarks. "Priority: Barbell > dumbbell." Bilateral squat, bilateral deadlift — these are the test. |
| 🔵 Structured | +5 | "Trackable. Repeatable." Barbell classics produce the most consistent performance data. scl-directory.md: 🔵 = "Prescribed sets/reps/rest." |
| 🟣 Technical | +4 | "Classic > novel." Precision under load matters for barbell technique. Basics is not sloppy — it is the technically correct execution of proven patterns. scl-directory.md: 🟣 = "Precision. Lower volume, extended rest, quality focus." |
| 📍 pono | +6 | Default preparatory operator for 🏛. "Set, position, assign. Stance, grip, body placement." The approach before the barbell classic. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🤌 facio | +6 | Default expressive operator for 🏛. "Execute, perform, produce. The concentric. The doing." scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| ▶️ Primer | +5 | "CNS activation. Bridges warm-up to main work. Neural potentiation." Heavy barbell work requires CNS priming. ⛽ block sequence: ♨️ ▶️ 🧈. scl-directory.md: block sequence guidelines. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal across all Orders. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| 🪜 Progression | +4 | "Loading ramps. Ladders." Barbell progression is the defining feature of Basics — the measured, trackable adding of load. scl-directory.md: 🪜 definition. |
| 🐂 Foundation | +4 | "Classic bilateral movements are natural Foundation exercises." Pattern learning at sub-maximal load fits barbell fundamentals. scl-directory.md: 🐂 character. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🟠 Circuit | -6 | "No barbells in 🟠." 🏛 is barbell-first. Hard conflict: the axis's primary tool is excluded by the color. scl-directory.md: "🟠 Circuit. Tier: 0–3. No barbells." |
| 🟢 Bodyweight | -4 | "🟢 = Tier 0–2 only." Bodyweight and bands cannot serve a barbell-first axis. Axis priority undercut by equipment constraint. scl-directory.md: 🟢 definition. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | -3 | "Priority: Isolation > compound. Cable/machine > barbell. Feeling > load." Direct inversion of Basics priority stack. scl-directory.md: 🌹 Aesthetic axis definition. |
| 🌾 Full Body | -2 | "Strict bilateral compound work may resist flow requirement." Barbell-only bilateral heavy movement is the opposite of integration flow. scl-directory.md: 🌾 = "Movements must flow into each other as one unified pattern." |

---

## 🔨 Functional

**Character:** Unilateral, standing, athletic-transfer movements. Priority: Unilateral > bilateral. Standing > seated. Free weight > machine. Ground-based > bench-based.

Self: +8 when primary Axis

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⚖ Balance | +5 | "Correction. Microscope on weak links and asymmetries." Unilateral work directly exposes bilateral compensation. "⚖🪡 = biceps, rear delts, forearms, grip." Unilateral correction is functional correction. scl-directory.md: ⚖ character. |
| 🌾 Full Body | +4 | "Unilateral, standing, athletic-transfer." Standing ground-based movements integrate naturally into full-body flow patterns. scl-directory.md: 🌾 = "Movements must flow into each other." |
| 🔴 Intense | +3 | Unilateral movements at high effort (lunges, single-leg RDLs, single-arm presses) are valid intensity vehicles. scl-directory.md: 🔴 = "Maximum effort. High volume. Supersets OK." |
| 🟡 Fun | +3 | "Exploration and variety." Novel unilateral patterns are naturally exploratory. scl-directory.md: 🟡 = "Structured play within constraints." |
| 🧸 fero | +6 | Default preparatory operator for 🔨. "Carry, transfer, channel. Loaded carries. What transfers across sessions." Athletic transfer is the defining intent. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🥨 tendo | +6 | Default expressive operator for 🔨. "Stretch, lengthen, push limits. Extend ROM. Reach lockout." Functional range-of-motion extension. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🌎 Exposure | +4 | "Reveal weaknesses under controlled stress. Expand movement vocabulary." Unilateral movements expose asymmetries by definition. scl-directory.md: 🌎 definition. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏟 Performance | -3 | "Strength benchmarks" in 🏟 favor bilateral testing (squat, deadlift, bench press max). Unilateral work is not the standard benchmark format. scl-directory.md: 🏟 = "strength benchmarks, conditioning benchmarks, movement assessments." |
| 🖼 Restoration | -2 | Unilateral loading, while sometimes appropriate in recovery, conflicts with the ≤55% ceiling and somatic intent. 🌹 Aesthetic is the native recovery lens. scl-directory.md: 🖼 character. |

---

## 🌹 Aesthetic

**Character:** Isolation, full ROM, mind-muscle connection. Priority: Isolation > compound. Cable/machine > barbell. Feeling > load. In 🖼 Restoration context: lens turns inward — pelvic floor, psoas, diaphragm, deep hip structures.

Self: +8 when primary Axis

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | +5 | "Muscle growth through volume and metabolic stress. The pump matters." Isolation and mind-muscle connection are the native tools of hypertrophy. scl-directory.md: 🦋 character. |
| 🖼 Restoration | +5 | "In 🖼 context: lens turns inward — pelvic floor, psoas, diaphragm, deep hip structures." Aesthetic axis gains a somatic dimension in restoration. scl-directory.md: 🌹 Aesthetic axis definition. The Restoration Lane: 🖼 + 🌹 + ⚪. |
| ⚪ Mindful | +5 | "Slow tempo (4s eccentrics). Extended rest (2+ min). Breath." Mindful's full-ROM slow tempo is the optimal execution style for isolation/mind-muscle work. 🖼 + 🌹 + ⚪ = deepest recovery. scl-directory.md: ⚪ and 🌹 joint note. |
| 🪞 Vanity | +6 | "Appearance-driven. Pump work. Mirror muscles. Honest. Stigma-free." Native to Aesthetic axis. scl-directory.md: 🪞 definition. |
| 🗿 Sculpt | +6 | "Hypertrophy shaping. Angles, tension, volume. Carving not admiring." Aesthetic axis is the selection bias behind sculpting choices. scl-directory.md: 🗿 definition. |
| 👀 specio | +6 | Default preparatory operator for 🌹. "Inspect, observe, assess form, monitor." Mind-muscle connection requires active observation. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🦢 plico | +6 | Default expressive operator for 🌹. "Fold, superset, compress, layer. Two exercises interwoven." Supersets and layered isolation are native to aesthetic training. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| 🪵 teneo | +4 | "Hold, anchor, persist. Isometrics. Sustained tension." Peak-contraction holds are a standard tool for isolation and mind-muscle connection. scl-directory.md: 🪵 definition. |
| 🟣 Technical | +3 | Isolation precision — cable path, joint alignment, ROM endpoints — is a technical execution question. scl-directory.md: 🟣 = "Precision. Quality focus." |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⛽ Strength | -4 | "Heavy loads, low reps, full recovery. Force production, not bodybuilding. The pump is irrelevant here." Direct inverse of Aesthetic intent. scl-directory.md: ⛽ character. |
| 🏟 Performance | -4 | Testing at max load is not isolation or mind-muscle connection. Contradicts Aesthetic's "Feeling > load" priority. scl-directory.md: 🏟 = "Testing, not training." |
| 🏛 Basics | -3 | "Priority: Barbell > dumbbell. Bilateral > unilateral. Compound > isolation." Exact inverse of Aesthetic's priority stack. scl-directory.md: 🏛 axis definition. |

## 🪐 Challenge

**Character:** Hardest variation at any level. Deficit, pause, tempo, bands/chains, unstable surfaces, stricter execution. Scales to the individual — always the hardest version they can control.

Self: +8 when primary Axis

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏟 Performance | +5 | Max difficulty (5/5) and hardest variation align with testing at peak capacity. "85–100%+ of 1RM. Reps 1–3." The hardest version of the test. scl-directory.md: 🏟 character. |
| 🔴 Intense | +5 | "Maximum effort. High volume. Reduced rest." Hardest variation + high effort = full Challenge expression. 🌋 Gutter is possible only here and in 🪐. scl-directory.md: 🔴 definition. |
| 🌋 Gutter | +6 | "All-out effort. Rare. Only in 🔴 and 🪐." Gutter is the native terminal block of 🪐. scl-directory.md: 🌋 definition. |
| 🚀 mitto | +6 | Default expressive operator for 🪐. "Dispatch, deploy, launch, commit. Explosive intent. Max attempt." The defining intent of Challenge under expressive colors. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🪵 teneo | +6 | Default preparatory operator for 🪐. "Hold, anchor, persist. Isometrics. Sustained tension. Duration as variable." Pauses, tempo work, and isometric holds are Challenge's primary tools under preparatory colors. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🟣 Technical | +5 | "Precision. Lower volume, extended rest, quality focus." The hardest variation requires the most technical precision. scl-directory.md: 🟣 definition. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| ⛽ Strength | +4 | Hardest variation at heavy load (pause squats, tempo deadlifts, deficit pulls) is a primary 🪐 expression. scl-directory.md: ⛽ character + 🪐 axis character. |
| 🪜 Progression | +3 | "Loading ramps. Ladders." Challenge progressions — building toward the hardest controllable rep — are valid. scl-directory.md: 🪜 definition. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🖼 Restoration | -5 | "Recovery without training debt. Max difficulty 2/5. Load ≤55%." Hardest variation directly contradicts recovery intent. scl-directory.md: 🖼 character. |
| 🐂 Foundation | -4 | "Max difficulty 2/5. Pattern learning at sub-maximal load." The hardest variation cannot be the on-ramp. scl-directory.md: 🐂 character. |
| ⚪ Mindful | -4 | "Slow tempo. Extended rest." Mindful's soft tempo and parasympathetic intent is not designed for maximal challenge. scl-directory.md: ⚪ definition. |
| 🟢 Bodyweight | -3 | Bodyweight can host Challenge (pistol squats, muscle-ups), but the axis's hardest-variation logic is partially undercut when equipment tier is limited to 0–2. Not a hard block. scl-directory.md: 🟢 = "Tier 0–2 only." |

## ⌛ Time

**Character:** Context axis. Enables EMOM, AMRAP, density blocks, timed sets, time trials, TUT, steady state, zone work. Protocol determined by Order × Color. Does not rank exercises — it recontextualizes them.

Self: +8 when primary Axis

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🌾 Full Body | +5 | Timed circuits and integrated movement flows are Time's native format. Flow and unity test maps naturally onto timed execution. scl-directory.md: 🌾 = "Movements flowing together as unified patterns." |
| 🟠 Circuit | +6 | "Station-based timed rotation." Circuit is a direct Time format expression. Loop logic requires timed station changes. scl-directory.md: 🟠 = "Station-based, timed rotation." |
| 🔴 Intense | +5 | "⌛🔴 = density/AMRAP." Intensity under time pressure is a primary ⌛ expression. scl-directory.md: ⌛ axis definition: "⌛🔴 = density/AMRAP." |
| ⚪ Mindful | +4 | "⌛⚪ = meditative holds." Extended slow tempo and timed holds are a Mindful × Time native format. scl-directory.md: ⌛ axis definition: "⌛⚪ = meditative holds." |
| 🔵 Structured | +4 | "⌛🔵 = EMOM." EMOM (every minute on the minute) is Time's most common structured expression. scl-directory.md: ⌛ axis definition: "⌛🔵 = EMOM." |
| 🏟 Performance | +4 | "⌛🏟 = time trials." Benchmarking time to completion is a standard Performance test format. scl-directory.md: ⌛ axis definition: "⌛🏟 = time trials." |
| 🐋 duco | +6 | Default preparatory operator for ⌛. "Orchestrate, lead, conduct. Session architecture and tempo flow." Time axis under preparatory colors is conducted, not chased. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| ✒️ grapho | +6 | Default expressive operator for ⌛. "Write, program, prescribe, document. Record the set. Log the PR." Time-based work demands documentation — splits, rounds, AMRAP totals. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| ➖ Ultra | +4 | "Cardiovascular system. Rowing, cycling, running." All conditioning work is measured in time. Time axis directly extends Ultra Type. scl-directory.md: ➖ Type definition. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏛 Basics | -3 | Heavy bilateral barbell work operates on rep-and-weight counting, not time. EMOMs are possible but time recontextualizes rather than serving Basics' primary format. scl-directory.md: 🏛 = "Barbell classics first." |
| ⛽ Strength | -3 | "3–4 min rest." Strict rest-based heavy loading conflicts with time-pressure formats. Density blocks and AMRAPs reduce rest below ⛽ minimum. scl-directory.md: ⛽ rest parameter. |

## 🐬 Partner

**Character:** Context axis. Enables spottable, alternating, synchronized, competitive, assisted, station rotation, scalable load, teachable exercises. Machine work deprioritized. Surfaces exercises that work with another person present.

Self: +8 when primary Axis

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🌾 Full Body | +4 | Cooperative movement and synchronized flow are naturally partner-viable. scl-directory.md: 🌾 = "Integration. Movements must flow." Partner-synchronized full-body patterns (partner carries, cooperative TGUs) are valid. |
| 🟢 Bodyweight | +4 | Bodyweight exercises are highly partner-viable: assisted progressions, partner-resisted work, spot-free access. No equipment barriers. scl-directory.md: 🟢 = "No gym required." |
| 🔵 Structured | +3 | "Trackable. Repeatable." Alternating partner sets on a structured protocol (one works, one rests) is the most common partner format. scl-directory.md: 🔵 definition. |
| 🟡 Fun | +4 | "Exploration and variety." Partner workouts naturally invite competition, games, and challenge formats. scl-directory.md: 🟡 = "Structured play within constraints." |
| 🧲 capio | +6 | Default preparatory operator for 🐬. "Receive, assess, intake." Partner context under preparatory colors: spotting, coaching, form assessment, receiving feedback. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🦉 logos | +6 | Default expressive operator for 🐬. "Reason, assess, analyze, interpret. Movement quality. Load calculation." Partner context under expressive colors: analyze each other's movement, reason about loading together. scl-directory.md: Axis × Color operator table. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| ⚫ Teaching | +4 | "Extra rest, coaching cues, comprehension over exertion." The partner axis is the most teachable context. A second person enables coaching, demonstration, and correction. scl-directory.md: ⚫ definition. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🌹 Aesthetic | -3 | "Machine work deprioritized." Aesthetic's bias toward cable/machine conflicts with Partner's machine-deprioritization. Additionally, mind-muscle connection is an internal, solo focus. scl-directory.md: 🐬 = "Machine work deprioritized." |
| 🏟 Performance | -3 | Max effort testing at 85–100%+ is a solo act. A partner can spot, but the test itself is individual. The cognitive load of max effort leaves little bandwidth for cooperative context. scl-directory.md: 🏟 = "Testing, not training." |
| 🪐 Challenge | -2 | Hardest controllable variation under extreme effort is usually a solo activity. The partner axis surfaces teachable and alternating work, not individual maximum challenge. scl-directory.md: 🪐 axis definition. |
