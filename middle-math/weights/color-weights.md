# Color Weight Declarations

Status: WORKING DRAFT — First-pass derivation from scl-directory.md rules. Weights will be refined as the system matures.

Each Color declares: self-weight (+8 when primary), equipment tier affinities/suppressions, GOLD gate status, polarity, and structural modifiers for block composition. Source rules are cited to scl-directory.md. All 8 Colors covered.

| 🔠 Choice | +4 | "⚫ Teaching (+4, safe learning space)." Bounded autonomy fits the teaching context |
| ♨️ Warm-Up | +4 | Extended warm-up time fits Teaching's comprehension-over-exertion character |
| 👀 specio | +4 | "Inspect, observe, assess form, monitor." Watching and correcting is core to teaching |
