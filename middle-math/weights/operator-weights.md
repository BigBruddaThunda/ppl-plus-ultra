# Operator Weight Declarations

Status: WORKING DRAFT — First-pass derivation from scl-directory.md rules and almanac-macro-operators.md seasonal mapping. Weights will be refined as the system matures.

Each Operator declares: self-weight when active (derived from Axis × Color polarity table), affinities (emojis it pulls positive), and suppressions (emojis it pushes negative). Month assignment and seasonal character are cited to seeds/almanac-macro-operators.md. Source rules are cited to scl-directory.md.
