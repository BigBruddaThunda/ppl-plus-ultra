# Order Weight Declarations

Status: DRAFT — First-pass derivation from scl-directory.md rules. Weights will be refined as the system matures.

Each Order declares: self-weight (+8 when primary), affinities (emojis it pulls positive), and suppressions (emojis it pushes negative). Source rules are cited to scl-directory.md. All 7 Orders covered.
