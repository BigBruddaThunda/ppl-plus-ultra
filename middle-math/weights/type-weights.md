# Type Weight Declarations

Status: WORKING DRAFT — First-pass derivation from scl-directory.md rules. Weights will be refined as the system matures.

Each Type declares: self-weight (+8 when primary), affinities (emojis it pulls positive), and suppressions (emojis it pushes negative). Source rules are cited to scl-directory.md. All 5 Types covered.

## 🛒 Push

**Character:** Chest, front deltoids, triceps. Horizontal pressing (bench, cable fly, dip) and vertical pressing (overhead press, landmine press, pike push-up). Exercise library: Section C (Chest), Section B (Shoulders — anterior/lateral), Section E (Arms — triceps, #51–95).

Self: +8 when primary Type

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏛 Basics | +4 | Barbell bench press and barbell overhead press are the defining bilateral barbell classics for Push. scl-directory.md: 🏛 = "Barbell > dumbbell. Bilateral > unilateral. Compound > isolation." |
| ⛽ Strength | +4 | Bench press and overhead press are primary strength benchmarks. Horizontal and vertical pressing under heavy load (75–85%) are canonical Push expressions. scl-directory.md: ⛽ = "Heavy loads, low reps, force production." |
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | +4 | Chest and shoulder volume training (cable flyes, dumbbell press, machine press) is a core 🦋 Push application. The pump in pressing is well-documented. scl-directory.md: 🦋 = "Muscle growth. Volume and metabolic stress. The pump matters." |
| 🖼 Restoration | +3 | "🖼🛒 = shoulder mobility, thoracic extension." Push Type in Restoration focuses on anterior chain release and pressing-pattern mobility. scl-directory.md: 🖼 × Type note. |
| ⚖ Balance | +3 | "⚖🛒 = triceps, side delts, front delts." Balance zooms in on Push's weaker secondary muscles. scl-directory.md: ⚖ × Type note. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| 🤌 facio | +3 | "Execute, perform, produce. The concentric. The doing." The concentric push — pressing the weight — is the defining motion of Push Type. scl-directory.md: 🤌 definition. |
| 🚀 mitto | +3 | "Dispatch, deploy, launch, commit. Explosive intent." Plyometric push variations (plyo push-up, explosive overhead press) and max-effort presses are Push expressions. scl-directory.md: 🚀 definition. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🪡 Pull | -6 | Push and Pull are direct antagonists: pressing vs. pulling, anterior chain vs. posterior chain. Selecting Pull exercises in a Push workout violates Type accuracy. scl-directory.md: 🛒 = "Chest, front delts, triceps" vs. 🪡 = "Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors." |
| 🍗 Legs | -5 | Lower body tissue is entirely outside Push's muscle group scope. scl-directory.md: 🛒 muscle group definition vs. 🍗 = "Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves." |
| ➖ Ultra | -4 | Cardiovascular conditioning is not a pressing-pattern Type. scl-directory.md: ➖ = "Cardiovascular system, energy systems, endurance." Push muscles are not the primary tissue in rowing, running, or cycling. |

## 🪡 Pull

**Character:** Lats, rear deltoids, biceps, traps, erector spinae. Row patterns, pulldown patterns, hinge patterns (deadlift, RDL). Exercise library: Section D (Back), Section B (Shoulders — posterior/rotator cuff), Section E (Arms — biceps, #1–50), Section G (Hips — hip hinge patterns).

Self: +8 when primary Type

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏛 Basics | +4 | Barbell deadlift, barbell row, and weighted pull-up are the bilateral barbell classics for Pull. scl-directory.md: 🏛 = "Barbell > dumbbell. Bilateral > unilateral. Compound > isolation. Classic > novel." |
| ⛽ Strength | +4 | Deadlift and barbell row are primary strength benchmarks. Heavy pulling under 75–85% is canonical Pull strength work. scl-directory.md: ⛽ = "Neural adaptation. Heavy loads, low reps, force production." |
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | +4 | Back volume (cable rows, lat pulldowns, dumbbell rows, machine pullovers) and bicep isolation are core 🦋 Pull applications. scl-directory.md: 🦋 = "Muscle growth. Volume. The pump matters." |
| 🖼 Restoration | +3 | "🖼🪡 = posterior chain tension release." Pull Type in Restoration: lat stretch, posterior capsule mobility, thoracic rotation, erector decompression. scl-directory.md: 🖼 × Type note. |
| ⚖ Balance | +3 | "⚖🪡 = biceps, rear delts, forearms, grip." Balance zooms in on Pull's secondary muscles — the ones often undertrained in push-dominant programs. scl-directory.md: ⚖ × Type note. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| 🧲 capio | +3 | "Receive, assess, intake. The catching phase. Absorbing the eccentric." The eccentric phase of pulling movements — controlled lowering on a row or pulldown — is the signal for growth. scl-directory.md: 🧲 definition. |
| 🥨 tendo | +3 | "Stretch, lengthen, push limits. Extend ROM." Full ROM pulling — arms long at the bottom of a row, full stretch in the lat on a pulldown — is a defining cue. scl-directory.md: 🥨 definition. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🛒 Push | -6 | Push and Pull are direct antagonists. Pressing exercises do not train Pull's muscle groups. scl-directory.md: 🪡 = "Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors" vs. 🛒 = "Chest, front delts, triceps." |
| 🍗 Legs | -5 | Lower body tissue is outside Pull's scope (with the exception of hip hinge patterns in Section G, which Pull legitimately shares). scl-directory.md: 🪡 muscle group definition. |
| ➖ Ultra | -4 | Cardiovascular conditioning is not a pulling-pattern Type. Rowing is the closest overlap (posterior chain engagement) but is properly routed to ➖ Ultra. scl-directory.md: ➖ = "Rowing, cycling, running, conditioning flows." |

|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏛 Basics | +4 | Barbell back squat, barbell front squat, and barbell deadlift hinge are the bilateral barbell classics for Legs. scl-directory.md: 🏛 = "Barbell > dumbbell. Bilateral > unilateral. Compound > isolation. Classic > novel." |
| ⛽ Strength | +4 | Back squat and deadlift are the primary lower-body strength benchmarks. Heavy bilateral leg loading (75–85%) is canonical ⛽🍗 territory. scl-directory.md: ⛽ = "Neural adaptation. Heavy loads, low reps." |
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | +4 | Leg volume (hack squats, leg press, leg curls, RDLs, split squats) is a core 🦋 application. Quad pump and glute development are canonical hypertrophy goals. scl-directory.md: 🦋 = "Muscle growth. Volume. The pump matters." |
| 🌾 Full Body | +4 | "Legs are the base of any full-body movement." Thrusters, squat cleans, clean-to-press, and farmer carries all require lower body engagement. scl-directory.md: 🌾 = "Valid: Thrusters, clean-to-press, Turkish get-ups." |
| 🖼 Restoration | +3 | "🖼🍗 = hip mobility, ankle, pelvic floor." Legs in Restoration: pigeon pose progressions, hip flexor release, calf stretch, tibialis work. scl-directory.md: 🖼 × Type note. |
| ⚖ Balance | +3 | "⚖🍗 = calves, adductors, tibialis." Balance zooms in on underworked leg musculature. scl-directory.md: ⚖ × Type note. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| 🚀 mitto | +3 | "Dispatch, deploy, launch, commit. Explosive intent." Jump squats, box jumps (GOLD-gated), and explosive lunge variations are Legs expressions under 🪐 or 🔴. scl-directory.md: 🚀 definition. |

| 🛒 Push | -5 | Pressing patterns (chest, front delts, triceps) are not lower-body tissue. scl-directory.md: 🍗 muscle group definition vs. 🛒. |
| 🪡 Pull | -5 | Pulling patterns (lats, rear delts, biceps, traps) are not lower-body tissue. (Hip hinge shared with Pull is an overlap, not a conflict — it stays in Legs' valid domain.) scl-directory.md: 🍗 muscle group definition vs. 🪡. |
| ➖ Ultra | -3 | Cardiovascular conditioning targets the energy system, not lower body musculature as the primary training outcome. Running and rowing use legs but the training effect is cardiovascular. scl-directory.md: ➖ = "Cardiovascular system, energy systems, endurance." |

Self: +8 when primary Type

### Affinities

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏟 Performance | +6 | "Full body power production." Olympic lifting tests and power benchmarks (snatch, clean and jerk, max broad jump) are Performance's native Plus expressions. scl-directory.md: 🏟 = "Strength benchmarks, conditioning benchmarks, movement assessments." |
| 🔴 Intense | +5 | "Maximum effort. High volume." GOLD unlocked. Plyometric and Olympic work under 🔴 is Plus's most expressive format. scl-directory.md: 🔴 = "GOLD: Yes." Plus Type requires 🔴 or 🟣 for GOLD sections. |
| 🟣 Technical | +5 | "Precision. Lower volume, extended rest, quality focus. GOLD: Yes." Olympic lift technique is the most technical expression of Plus. Fewer reps, longer rest, maximal precision. scl-directory.md: 🟣 = "GOLD: Yes. Session ends when quality degrades." |
| 🖼 Restoration | +3 | "🖼➕ = core as breath system, diaphragm, TVA." Plus in Restoration is diaphragmatic breathing, TVA activation, anti-rotation holds. scl-directory.md: 🖼 × Type note. |
| ⚖ Balance | +3 | "⚖➕ = rotational stability, anti-rotation." Balance zooms in on Plus's stabilization demands. scl-directory.md: ⚖ × Type note. |
| 🧈 Bread & Butter | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." Universal. scl-directory.md: 🧈 definition. |
| 🚀 mitto | +6 | "Dispatch, deploy, launch, commit. Explosive intent. Max attempt." Defines Plus Type under expressive colors. Snatch, clean and jerk, box jumps, broad jumps. scl-directory.md: 🚀 definition. |
| 🌾 Full Body | +5 | "Full body power production" is the definition of integration. Thrusters, clean-to-press, Turkish get-ups, man makers — all Plus movements, all Full Body compliant. scl-directory.md: 🌾 = "Valid: Thrusters, clean-to-press, Turkish get-ups, man makers." |
| 🪜 Progression | +4 | "Loading ramps. Ladders." Ramping to heavy Olympic lifts or plyometric complexity progressions are canonical Plus structures. scl-directory.md: 🪜 definition. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🟢 Bodyweight | -3 | "Tier 0–2 only." Most GOLD exercises (Olympic lifts, strongman) require barbells (Tier 3) or specialty equipment (Tier 5). Bodyweight blocks the primary tools of Plus. scl-directory.md: 🟢 = "Tier 0–2 only. GOLD: No." |
| 🟠 Circuit | -3 | "No barbells in 🟠." GOLD exercises require barbells or specialty implements. Circuit format blocks Plus's most powerful tools. scl-directory.md: 🟠 = "Tier 0–3. No barbells. GOLD: No." |
| 🖼 Restoration | -3 | Low load (≤55%) and CNS:Low cannot host Olympic lifts or plyometrics. Only the somatic/core subgroup of Plus (TVA, diaphragm) survives in Restoration. scl-directory.md: 🖼 = "Max difficulty 2/5. Load ≤55%." |

|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⌛ Time | +6 | "Enables EMOM, AMRAP, density blocks, timed sets, time trials, TUT, steady state, zone work." All conditioning work is measured in time. Time is Ultra's native axis. scl-directory.md: ⌛ axis definition. |
| 🖼 Restoration | +4 | "🖼➖ = nervous system regulation, somatic work." Active recovery (zone 2 aerobic work, gentle mobility flows) is a valid Restoration expression of Ultra. scl-directory.md: 🖼 × Type note. |
| ⚖ Balance | +4 | "⚖➖ = energy system gaps, aerobic base." Aerobic base building is a form of correction — filling in the cardiovascular deficit. scl-directory.md: ⚖ × Type note. |
| 🌾 Full Body | +4 | Conditioning work that integrates movement patterns (rowing, assault bike, sled push) complements full-body integration. ➖ can serve as the conditioning component of Full Body sessions. scl-directory.md: 🌾 = "Integration. Movements flowing together." |
| 🟠 Circuit | +4 | "Station-based timed rotation." Conditioning circuits (assault bike / rower / ski erg rotation) are Ultra's native circuit expression. scl-directory.md: 🟠 = "Station-based, timed rotation." |
| 🔴 Intense | +5 | "Maximum effort. High volume. Reduced rest." High-intensity interval work (HIIT, AMRAPs, Tabata intervals) is Ultra's most expressive format. scl-directory.md: 🔴 = "Maximum effort. High volume. Reduced rest 30–60s." |
| 🐋 duco | +4 | "Orchestrate, lead, conduct. Session architecture and tempo flow." Pacing and energy system management are the defining cognitive skills of cardiovascular training. scl-directory.md: 🐋 definition. |

### Suppressions

| Emoji | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⛽ Strength | -4 | "Neural adaptation. Heavy loads, low reps, full recovery." Ultra's training effect (cardiovascular and aerobic adaptation) is the opposite of strength's neural force-production adaptation. scl-directory.md: ⛽ = "Force production, not bodybuilding. The pump is irrelevant." |
| 🏛 Basics | -3 | "Barbell classics first." Bilateral barbell work is not the native tool of cardiovascular conditioning. scl-directory.md: 🏛 = "Barbell > dumbbell. Bilateral > unilateral. Compound > isolation." |
| 🪞 Vanity | -4 | "Appearance-driven. Pump work. Mirror muscles." The cardiovascular system is not a mirror muscle. Ultra training produces adaptation, not cosmetic pump. scl-directory.md: 🪞 definition. |
| 🗿 Sculpt | -4 | "Hypertrophy shaping. Angles, tension, volume." Sculpting is a tissue-specific hypertrophy goal. Ultra does not target individual muscle architecture. scl-directory.md: 🗿 definition. |
