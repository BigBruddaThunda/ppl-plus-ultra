# SCL Weight System

Every emoji in the 61-emoji SCL carries a weight at every zip code address.

The weight uses the octave scale: -8 to +8, with 0 as neutral center.

## The Scale

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| +8 | Defining. This IS the output's character. |
| +7 | Dominant. Cannot be missed. |
| +6 | Strong. Clearly shaping the output. |
| +5 | Above average. Reliable influence. |
| +4 | Equal presence. Balanced. |
| +3 | Contributing. Part of the texture. |
| +2 | Noticeable if paying attention. |
| +1 | Present but barely. Background hum. |
| 0 | Neutral. Neither sounding nor muted. |
| -1 | Slightly deprioritized. |
| -2 | Noticeably absent. |
| -3 | Actively avoided. |
| -4 | Suppressed. Won't surface naturally. |
| -5 | Excluded unless overridden. |
| -6 | Contradicts the address. |
| -7 | Violation territory. |
| -8 | Hard exclusion. The rule says never. |
