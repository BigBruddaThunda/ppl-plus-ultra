# Block Weight Declarations

Status: WORKING DRAFT — First-pass derivation from scl-directory.md rules. Weights will be refined as the system matures.

Each Block declares: self-weight when active, role, position, required status, Order/Color affinities and suppressions, and positional constraints. Source rules are cited to scl-directory.md and CLAUDE.md. All 22 Blocks + 🧮 SAVE covered.

---

## Universal Blocks (present in all addresses)

---

## ♨️ Warm-Up

Role: Orientation / Access
Position: First (always opens unless 🎯 precedes in 🖼 context)
Required: Yes — always present in every address

Self: +8 when active

### Order Affinities

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🐂 Foundation | +4 | "Always present. Always first." Universal. Content shifts to mobility and pattern intro at sub-maximal load |
| ⛽ Strength | +4 | "Always present." High CNS demand requires thorough warm-up priming |
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | +4 | "Always present." Muscle activation and blood flow priming before volume work |
| 🏟 Performance | +4 | "Always present." Pre-test preparation — abbreviated but mandatory |
| 🌾 Full Body | +4 | "Always present." Integration flow starts in warm-up |
| ⚖ Balance | +4 | "Always present." Corrective warm-up activates target patterns |
| 🖼 Restoration | +4 | "Always present." In 🖼, warm-up is the somatic arrival — extended in scope |

### Color Affinities

| Color | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⚪ Mindful | +5 | "Extended ♨️" — structural modifier. Mindful warm-up is lengthened beyond standard |
| ⚫ Teaching | +4 | Extended rest and teaching cues begin in warm-up |
| 🟢 Bodyweight | +3 | Bodyweight movement and mobility fits warm-up tier |

### Order Suppressions

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| — | — | Nothing hard-suppresses ♨️. It is the mandatory opener. |

### Positional Notes

♨️ always opens the session. Exception: 🖼 Restoration block sequence begins with 🎯 Intention, which precedes ♨️ by design.

---

## 🧈 Bread & Butter

Role: Transformation
Position: Mid (core of session)
Required: Yes — always present in every address. Content is entirely context-dependent.

Self: +8 when active

### Order Affinities

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🐂 Foundation | +8 | "Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus." In 🐂: the main pattern work |
| ⛽ Strength | +8 | "Always present." In ⛽: the heavy main lifts |
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | +8 | "Always present." In 🦋: the accumulation sets |
| 🏟 Performance | +8 | "In 🏟 it is the test itself." The test IS the Bread & Butter |
| 🌾 Full Body | +8 | "In 🌾 it is the main integrated pattern." |
| ⚖ Balance | +8 | "In ⚖ it is targeted accessory compounds addressing the specific gap." |
| 🖼 Restoration | +8 | "In 🖼 it is the main mobility or somatic sequence." |

### Order Suppressions

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| — | — | Nothing suppresses 🧈. It IS the work in every address. |

### Positional Notes

🧈 is the fulcrum of every session. Its content changes completely by Order — the name is fixed, the expression is zip-code-specific. A heavy lift in ⛽ and a somatic sequence in 🖼 are both 🧈.

---

## 🚂 Junction

Role: Retention
Position: Last (always before 🧮 SAVE)
Required: Yes — always present. Must include 1–3 follow-up zip codes with rationale.

Self: +8 when active

### Order Affinities

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🐂 Foundation | +6 | "Present in all Order block sequences." Bridge to next session |

| 🦋 Hypertrophy | +6 | "Always present." Logging volume and next-session bridge |
| 🏟 Performance | +6 | "Always present, critical for logging test results." Record the PR, plan next test |
| 🌾 Full Body | +6 | "Always present." Bridge integration patterns forward |
| ⚖ Balance | +6 | "Always present." Log correction work, plan next targeted session |
| 🖼 Restoration | +6 | "Always present." Somatic session closing and forward bridge |

### Order Suppressions

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| — | — | Nothing hard-suppresses 🚂. It IS the closer in every address (before 🧮). |

### Positional Notes

🚂 is the penultimate block in every session. 🧮 SAVE always follows. Format requires 1–3 follow-up zip codes with rationale: `Next → [zip] — [one-line reason]`.

---

## 🧮 SAVE

Role: System close
Position: Last (absolute final block in every session)
Required: Yes — every workout ends here.

Self: +8 when active

### Order Affinities

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🐂 Foundation | +8 | "Every workout ends here." Closing ritual for every address |
| ⛽ Strength | +8 | Universal |

| 🏟 Performance | +8 | Universal — log the test result and close |
| 🌾 Full Body | +8 | Universal |
| ⚖ Balance | +8 | Universal |
| 🖼 Restoration | +8 | Universal |

### Order Suppressions

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| — | — | Nothing suppresses 🧮. It is the mandatory closer. No exceptions. |

### Positional Notes

🧮 SAVE carries a closing principle (1–2 sentences). The principle transfers the work — it does not praise the user. Tonal rule applies: no "Great job today." The session is logged. The room is closed.

## Conditional Blocks (appear based on Order, Color, or Axis)

---

## 🎯 Intention

Role: Orientation
Position: First (opens 🖼 sessions before ♨️)
Required: No — context-dependent. Strong in 🖼 Restoration.

Self: +6 when active

### Order Affinities

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|

| ⚖ Balance | +4 | Framing the correction intent is valuable in targeted work |
| 🐂 Foundation | +3 | Framing the learning intention helps new skill contexts |

### Color Affinities

| Color | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⚪ Mindful | +5 | Intentional arrival statement fits the Mindful entry posture |
| ⚫ Teaching | +4 | Framing what is being learned primes comprehension |

### Order Suppressions

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏟 Performance | -3 | Test sessions don't need intention-setting — they just test. The warm-up and ramp are sufficient framing. |

### Positional Notes

In 🖼, 🎯 opens the session before ♨️. In all other Orders, it is optional and appears early but after ♨️ if used.

---

## 🔢 Fundamentals

Role: Access

| 🖼 Restoration | +4 | Post-layoff or injury re-entry contexts benefit from fundamentals re-grounding |
| ⚖ Balance | +3 | Corrective sessions may return to fundamental movement patterns |

### Color Affinities

|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⚫ Teaching | +6 | "⚫ = safe learning." Fundamentals block is deeply native to Teaching context |
| ⚪ Mindful | +3 | Slow, deliberate return to basics fits the Mindful character |

### Order Suppressions

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🏟 Performance | -5 | Test sessions have no time for re-grounding. The ramp (🪜) replaces fundamentals work. |
| ⛽ Strength | -3 | Advanced strength sessions have moved past re-grounding — Primer (▶️) serves the access function instead |

|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🖼 Restoration | -5 | "CNS activation blocks contradict restoration CNS demand." From order-weights.md. Recovery intent is opposite of neural priming. |
| 🐂 Foundation | -3 | Pattern learning at low load does not require CNS priming of this type — 🔢 or 🛠 serve the access function instead |

### Color Suppressions

| Color | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| ⚪ Mindful | -4 | CNS activation contradicts the parasympathetic, slow-tempo character of Mindful |

Position: Early-mid (before 🧈, deliberate pre-fatigue)
Required: No — context-specific to Aesthetic axis and Intense color

Self: +5 when active

### Order Affinities

| Order | Weight | Source Rule |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | +4 | Pre-exhaustion is a hypertrophy technique — fatiguing a target muscle before the compound |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | +5 | "Pre-exhaustion is an Aesthetic technique." Pre-fatigue with purpose fits the Aesthetic isolation-first philosophy |
| 🔴 Intense | +4 | "Deliberate sacrifice for positional advantage." Intense context accommodates deliberate pre-fatigue |

### Color Affinities

|-------|--------|-------------|
| 🐂 Foundation | -4 | "Gambit requires baseline capacity." Pre-fatigue without established patterns creates poor learning conditions |
| 🏟 Performance | -5 | Pre-fatigue before a test is actively harmful to performance. Never in 🏟. |
| 🖼 Restoration | -5 | Deliberate pre-fatigue contradicts recovery-without-debt intent |

### Hard Rules (non-negotiable)

| Rule | Weight | Source Rule |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Loop logic required | — | "Every station must change which tissue is working. No two adjacent stations target the same muscle group." |
