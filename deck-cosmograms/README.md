# Deck Cosmograms

Deep research identity documents for each of the 42 decks.

---

## What These Are

Each cosmogram captures the cultural, philosophical, architectural,
agricultural, educational, and movement-science identity of a single
Order × Axis intersection. They are the DNA that informs card
generation, block content, HTML design, junction routing, and
almanac content. The user never reads these. They experience the
zip code rooms these documents shape.

**Status: PLANNED**

Directory structure planted. No cosmograms populated yet.
Template and research prompt need to be written before population
begins. See `seeds/cosmogram-research-prompt.md` (when written).

## How They Will Work

- One file per deck: `deck-[01-42]-cosmogram.md`
- Generated via dedicated AI research sessions with web access
- Each session is independent — can run in parallel
- Research prompt carries full SCL context as a one-shot briefing
- Output informs: exercise selection, block content character,
  junction routing, tonal guidance, naming, almanac content

## Relationship to Card Generation

When generating cards for a deck, the cosmogram (if populated) is
read after `CLAUDE.md` and `scl-directory.md` for deep context. If no
cosmogram exists, generation proceeds using `scl-directory.md` and
deck identity alone. Cosmograms are supplemental, not blocking.
