## What This License Covers

The **PPL± Semantic Compression Language (SCL)** as a system — including:

- The 4-dial zip code addressing system (ORDER × AXIS × TYPE × COLOR)
- The 61-emoji SCL dictionary and their assigned positions and roles
- The 7 Orders and their load protocol specifications
- The 6 Axes and their exercise selection bias framework
- The 5 Types and their muscle group mappings
- The 8 Colors and their equipment tier rules
- The 22 Blocks and the SAVE system
- The 12 Operators and their Latin derivations
- The operator polarity table (Preparatory vs. Expressive)
- The constraint hierarchy (Order → Color → Axis → Equipment)
- The weight vector mathematics (octave scale, interaction rules, affinity/suppression tables)
- The 4-digit numeric zip notation system
- The block sequence guidelines by Order
- The GOLD gate rule and its conditions
- The deck derivation formula (deck = (order − 1) × 6 + axis)
- The rotation engine specifications (3-gear system, coprime cycles)
- The Almanac macro operator calendar (12-month operator assignments)

In short: the **language itself** — the rules that generate all 1,680 addresses.
