# ZIP Web Map

This document is the canonical map content for the ZIP Web rollout.

## Iteration Workflow (Audit Rule)

Each implementation iteration must edit exactly these two files:

1. `zip-web.md` — map content updates for the current iteration.
2. `zip-web-tasks.md` — exactly one checkbox transition from unchecked to checked.

No other files should be modified during a standard ZIP Web task-loop iteration.
