# 🪡 Pull Circuit — Full Back, Full Loop 🪡

Station-based pull circuit, no barbells | Lats, traps, rear delts, biceps, erectors | 50–60 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🪡🟠

> "Five stations, five tissue zones — nothing repeats until the loop is complete."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — prepare the pulling chain before the circuit begins

- 8 Dead Hang (30 sec passive)
- 10 Scapular Pull-Up (retract and depress cleanly)
- 12 Band Pull-Apart
- 8/side Prone Y-Raise
- 8 Cat-Cow

Preview each station once at 50% effort before the loop starts.

## 2. 🎱 ARAM

🤌 facio — tissue rotation loop, 3 rounds

Loop logic: each station changes which tissue is working. No two adjacent stations train the same muscle group.

Rest between stations: 15–20 sec (rotate and set up)
Rest between rounds: 3 min

```
Station A — Lats              Station B — Upper Traps
Pull-Up (Overhand)            Dumbbell Shrug
× 5 reps                      × 6 reps
(full hang, chin over bar)    (straight up, 1 sec hold)

Station C — Rear Delts        Station D — Erectors
Band Face Pull                Kettlebell Deadlift
× 10 reps                     × 5 reps
(thumbs back, elbows high)    (hinge not squat, full lockout)

Station E — Biceps
Dumbbell Curl (Standard)
× 6 reps
(full extension down)

→ return to Station A for next round
```

**Load guidance:** Dumbbells and kettlebells at the heavy end of what you can control for 5–6 reps. Pull-Up: add a vest if all reps feel easy across 3 rounds.

Run 3 complete rounds.

## 3. 🪫 RELEASE

- 60 sec/side Doorway Lat Stretch (arm extended, rotate torso away)
- 60 sec Child's Pose (arms extended)
- 8 slow Cat-Cow

## 🧮 SAVE

Five tissue zones, three rounds, no barbells. The back works fully in a different context than a barbell session. That difference has value.
