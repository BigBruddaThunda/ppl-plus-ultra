# 🪡 Slow Pull — Deliberate Heavy Descent 🪡

Strength pull with 4-second eccentrics and full breath | Lats, erectors, traps, biceps | 70–80 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🪡⚪

> "Heavy and unhurried — inhale on the way down, hold the position, and pull with what you built."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — arrive slowly, on purpose

The ⚪ warm-up is extended. Take the full time.

- 60 sec Dead Hang (breathe into the stretch, not through it)
- 8 Scapular Pull-Up (4 sec down — slow retraction, slow release)
- 10 Band Pull-Apart
- 8/side Prone Y-Raise (hold 2 sec at top — feel the lower traps)
- 10 Cat-Cow (one breath per movement, thoracic then lumbar)
- 60 sec Child's Pose (arms extended, breathe into the lower back)

Rest: 60 sec between movements.

**Breath pattern:** Inhale on the eccentric (the lowering). Exhale on the concentric (the pulling). In for 4 counts. Out for 2.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — find the tempo before finding the load

Primer sets are tempo rehearsal as much as tissue prep.

- Set 1: 🪡 Romanian Deadlift at 40% × 5 — 4-sec lower, 1-sec hold, 2-sec pull
- Set 2: 🪡 Romanian Deadlift at 50% × 5 — same tempo

(4 sec down: hips back, bar drags the legs — feel every inch of hamstring stretch. 1 sec hold: no bounce, don't lose the arch. 2 sec to standing: hips drive forward, breath out.)

Rest: 2 min.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — heavy pull, slow eccentric on every rep

Tempo: 4-1-2-0 (4 sec eccentric | 1 sec hold at bottom | 2 sec concentric | 0 sec at top)

Rest: 3–4 min. Extended rest mandatory under ⚪.

**A. 🪡 Deadlift (Conventional) — Slow Eccentric**

The slow eccentric applies on the way down from lockout. Not how most deadlifts go — significantly harder per rep.

- Set 1: 75% × 5 (4-sec lower to the floor — inhale one, two, three, four — bar touches)
- Set 2: 77.5% × 5 (breathe in on the way down, brace, pull, breathe out)
- Set 3: 80% × 4 (4 reps with control beats 5 with rush)
- Set 4: 77.5% × 5 (back-off — practiced, not fatigued)

**B. 🪡 Bent-Over Barbell Row (Overhand) — Slow Eccentric**

Lower the bar slowly from the contracted position. The stretch at the bottom is the point.

- Set 1: 75% × 5 (hold 1 sec at top, 4-sec lower — feel the lat stretch)
- Set 2: 77.5% × 5 (inhale as the bar descends — expand the thoracic)
- Set 3: 77.5% × 4 (hold 2 sec at the top this time, then 4-sec lower)
- Set 4: 75% × 5 (back-off — same load as Set 1, should feel lighter)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — parasympathetic downregulation, tension DOWN

⚪ release: not just stretching — arriving in the body.

- 2 min Hanging Lat Stretch (breathe in 4, out 6 — longer exhale than inhale)
- 90 sec/side Kneeling Lat Stretch (breathe into the stretched side)
- 90 sec Child's Pose (on every exhale, let the body sink a little further)
- 10 slow Cat-Cow (one breath per movement)
- 60 sec/side Lying Spinal Twist (exhale deepens the twist)

No timer on the release. Stay until the breath has steadied.

## 🧮 SAVE

The 4-second eccentric earns time under tension that fast reps skip. The breath is not decoration — it is the tempo. Let it lead.
