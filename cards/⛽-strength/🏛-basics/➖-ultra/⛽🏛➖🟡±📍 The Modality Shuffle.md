# ➖ The Modality Shuffle ➖

Varied conditioning | Erg, bike, sprint — then one you haven't tried seriously | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🟡

> "Same ceiling, different tools. Find out which machine you actually like."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — fun color does not mean casual. The ⛽ ceiling still applies.

- 3 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (easy stroke, 18 spm, damper 3)
- 2 min Assault Bike (Steady State) (easy pedal, arms and legs)
- 2 min Jump Rope (Steady State) (easy bounce, find the wrist rhythm)
- Dynamic prep:
  - 10 Inchworm Walkout
  - 10 Walking Lunge with Twist
  - 10/leg Leg Swings (Forward/Backward)
  - 10 World's Greatest Stretch (one per side, slow)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — three modalities, two intervals each, full recovery between every interval

Rest: 3 min between all intervals.

**Erg Block**
- Interval 1: Rowing Intervals (500m) — max effort (28–30 spm, full leg drive — set the benchmark)
- Interval 2: Rowing Intervals (500m) — max effort (hold within 3 sec of Interval 1)

**Bike Block**
- Interval 3: Assault Bike Intervals (30 sec on / 30 sec off) — max effort (arms and legs equally)
- Interval 4: Assault Bike Intervals (30 sec on / 30 sec off) — max effort (hold the same output)

**Sprint Block**
- Interval 5: Sprint (60–100 meters) — max effort (drive from the ankles, not the hips)
- Interval 6: Sprint (60–100 meters) — max effort (stay relaxed in the upper body — tension kills speed)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🏖 SANDBOX

📍 pono — one modality you have not used seriously in an interval session, or one you have been curious about. The constraint: it must be a classic conditioning tool. The effort: max output.

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**Choose one:**

**Option A — Ski Erg Intervals (500m)**
- Set 1 + Set 2: max effort (double arm pull, hinge at the hips — not a biceps curl)

**Option B — Sled Sprint (Resisted) — 20 meters**
- Set 1 + Set 2: max effort (lean forward, sprint stance, drive the knee — the resistance changes everything)

**Option C — Battle Ropes (Intervals) — 30 sec on, 60 sec rest**
- Set 1 + Set 2: max effort (alternating waves, drive from the shoulders — core stays engaged)

Log which option you chose and subjective output. Note how it compares to the main three modalities.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — jump rope to close. Different from everything above.

Rest: 90 sec between sets.

**2 × Jump Rope Sprint Intervals (45 sec on / 90 sec rest)**

- Set 1: max effort (go for speed — wrists loose, feet quick, soft landing)
- Set 2: max effort (hold the same output — don't sandbag the last set)

- ⛽🏛➖🔵 — commit to one modality: structured 5 × 500m, nothing else
- ⛽🏛➖🟢 — take the sprint block outside: no machines at all
- ⛽🏛➖🟠 — take this variety into a circuit format with station logic

## 🧮 SAVE

Variety is not the same as randomness. Every modality in this session has been used seriously before. Running them back-to-back reveals which system carries the load and which one drops first. That data informs the next structured session.
