# ➖ The Modality Shuffle ➖

**Varied conditioning exploration | Cardiovascular system | 55–65 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🟡

> "Same ceiling, different tools. Find out which machine you actually like."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟡♨️ (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–5)

Fun color does not mean lazy. The ⛽ ceiling still applies — this session runs at high output. The variety is in the tools, not the effort.

├─ 3 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (easy stroke, 18 spm, damper 3)
├─ 2 min ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) (easy pedal, arms and legs, just warming the mechanism)
├─ 2 min ➖ Jump Rope (Steady State) (easy bounce, find the wrist rhythm)
└─ Dynamic prep:
   ├─ 10 ➖ Inchworm Walkout (feel the hamstrings wake up)
   ├─ 10 ➖ Walking Lunge with Twist (hip flexors and thoracic rotation)
   ├─ 10 ➖ Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) per leg (hip range of motion)
   └─ 10 ➖ World's Greatest Stretch (one per side, slow)

Rest: None. Continuous flow.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟡▶️ (Primer | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–5)

One primer interval on each major modality — make friends with each tool before you push them.

├─ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) at 80% effort
│  (26 spm, controlled acceleration — settle into the stroke)
│  Rest: 2 min.
│
├─ 1 × ➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) — 30 sec at 80% effort
│  (arms and legs both engaged — equal push and pull)
│  Rest: 2 min.
│
└─ 1 × ➖ Sprint (30-60 meters) at 80% effort
   (controlled — not a full sprint, just find the running shape)
   Rest: 2 min before the main block.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–5)

The main block is a rotating sequence across three classic conditioning tools. Erg first (the anchor), then bike, then sprint. Each modality gets two full working intervals. This is not a circuit — there is full rest between each interval.

**Modality Rotation: 2 intervals per tool, full recovery**

**Erg Block:**
├─ Interval 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (28–30 spm, full leg drive, set the benchmark)
│  Rest: 3 min. Record split.
│
└─ Interval 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
   (hold within 3 sec of Interval 1 — the legs are still there)
   Rest: 3 min.

**Bike Block:**
├─ Interval 3: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) — 30 sec on, 30 sec off
│  (full push — arms and legs at the same time, no coasting)
│  Rest: 3 min full recovery.
│
└─ Interval 4: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) — 30 sec on, 30 sec off
   (hold the same output as Interval 3)
   Rest: 3 min.

**Sprint Block:**
├─ Interval 5: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters)
│  (full acceleration — arms, drive, lean from the ankles)
│  Rest: 3–4 min walk-back.
│
└─ Interval 6: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters)
   (match Interval 5 — stay relaxed in the upper body)
   Rest: 3–4 min before sandbox.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🏖 SANDBOX

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟡🏖 (Sandbox | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–5)

Constrained exploration. Choose one modality you have never used in a serious interval session, or one you have been curious about. The constraint: it must be a classic conditioning tool from Section M. The effort: max output.

**Choose one:**

Option A: ➖ Ski Erg Intervals (500m) — if a ski erg is available
├─ Set 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Ski Erg Intervals (500m)
│  (double arm pull, hinge at the hips — not a biceps curl)
│  Rest: 3 min.
└─ Set 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Ski Erg Intervals (500m)
   Rest: 3 min.

Option B: ➖ Sled Sprint (Resisted) — if a sled is available
├─ Set 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sled Sprint (Resisted) — 20 meters, moderate load
│  (lean forward, sprint stance, drive the knee — the resistance changes the feeling)
│  Rest: 3 min.
└─ Set 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sled Sprint (Resisted) — 20 meters
   Rest: 3 min.

Option C: ➖ Battle Ropes (Intervals) — if available
├─ Set 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Battle Ropes (Intervals) — 30 sec on, 60 sec rest
│  (alternating waves, drive from the shoulders — keep the core engaged)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Battle Ropes (Intervals) — 30 sec on
   Rest: 3 min.

Log which option you chose and your subjective output. Note how it compares to the main tools.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟡🧩 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–1)

Two final jump rope intervals. Low equipment, high output, shifts the demand away from the main tools. Bookend the session with something that feels different from all of the above.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Jump Rope Sprint Intervals — 45 sec on, 90 sec rest
│  (go for speed — wrists loose, feet quick, soft landing)
│
└─ Set 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Jump Rope Sprint Intervals — 45 sec on
   (hold the same output — don't sandbag the last set)
   Rest: 3 min before release.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟡🪫 (Release | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–3)

Six intervals across three modalities plus sandbox and supplemental is a full session. The release is proportional.

├─ 5 min ➖ Walking (Zone 2 Heart Rate) (easy pace, breathe out the effort)
├─ Static sequence:
│  ├─ Standing Hamstring Stretch — 45 sec per leg (sprinting and rowing both hit the posterior chain)
│  ├─ Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) — 60 sec per side (bike and sprint both load the hip flexors)
│  ├─ Seated Forward Fold — 60 sec (lumbar decompression after the erg position)
│  └─ Standing Calf Stretch (Gastrocnemius) — 45 sec per leg (sprinting and jump rope tax the calves)

Rest: Unhurried.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 7. 🚂 JUNCTION

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟡🚂 (Junction | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–5)

**Session log:**

| Interval | Modality | Distance/Time | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primer 1 | Rowing | 500m | 80% | |
| Primer 2 | Assault Bike | 30 sec | 80% | |
| Primer 3 | Sprint | 30–60m | 80% | |
| 1 | Rowing | 500m | max | |
| 2 | Rowing | 500m | max | |
| 3 | Assault Bike | 30 sec | max | |
| 4 | Assault Bike | 30 sec | max | |
| 5 | Sprint | 60–100m | max | |
| 6 | Sprint | 60–100m | max | |
| Sandbox 1 | | | max | |
| Sandbox 2 | | | max | |
| Supp 1 | Jump Rope | 45 sec | max | |
| Supp 2 | Jump Rope | 45 sec | max | |

**Sandbox option chosen:**

**Which modality felt strongest:**

**Which felt worst — and why:**

**Next session bridges:**

Next → ⛽🏛➖🔵 — commit to one modality: structured 5 × 500m rowing, nothing else
Next → ⛽🏛➖🟢 — take the sprint block outside: no machines at all
Next → ⛽🏛➖🟠 — take this variety into a circuit format with station logic

## 🧮 SAVE

Variety is not the same as randomness. Every modality in this session has been used seriously before. The exploration is in the combination — running them back to back within a single session reveals which system carries the load and which one drops first. That data informs the next structured session.
