# ➖ Outside the Gym ➖

**Bodyweight conditioning | Cardiovascular system | 45–55 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🟢

> "The most honest test of fitness is what you can do when the equipment is gone."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟢♨️ (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0)

Start easy. The sprint work that follows is full CNS demand — the joints need to be ready for it.

├─ 3 min ➖ Walking (Zone 2 Heart Rate) (easy pace, breathe through the nose, no rush)
├─ Dynamic prep sequence:
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Walking High Knees (drive the knee to hip height, tall spine)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Walking Butt Kicks (heel to glute, stay upright)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Walking Lunge with Twist (long stride, rotate over the front knee)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) per leg (hold a wall, full swing range)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Leg Swings (Lateral/Side-to-Side) per leg (controlled, not flopping)
│  └─ 10 ➖ Inchworm Walkout (slow, press through the shoulders at the top)
└─ 2 min ➖ Tempo Run (Moderate Pace) (easy jog to settle the system, nothing fast yet)

Rest: None. Continuous movement.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟢▶️ (Primer | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0)

Two build-up runs. Teach the nervous system the acceleration pattern before the full sprints hit.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters) at 70% effort (controlled acceleration, not a full sprint)
│  (drive the knees, lean slightly forward from the ankles — not the hips)
│  Rest: 3 min walk-back recovery.
│
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters) at 85% effort (fast but not all-out)
   (stay relaxed in the shoulders — tension kills sprint speed)
   Rest: 3 min walk-back recovery before main work.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟢🧈 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0)

Classic sprint intervals. The erg is not here. The track or a clear 60-meter surface is the machine. Full effort. Full recovery. The strength order means nothing moderate — you are running at max output.

**5 × Sprint (60-100 meters) — Max Effort**

├─ Interval 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters) (drive position, push through toe-off)
│  (arms at 90 degrees, drive back — not across the body)
│  Rest: 3–4 min walk-back recovery.
│
├─ Interval 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters) (same cue: arms back, not across)
│  (match or beat Interval 1)
│  Rest: 3–4 min walk-back recovery.
│
├─ Interval 3: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters) (stay tall in the hips — don't sit)
│  (hips forward, drive the knee, push the ground away)
│  Rest: 3–4 min walk-back recovery.
│
├─ Interval 4: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters) (this one will feel harder — hold form)
│  (breathe before you go — full inhale, then sprint)
│  Rest: 4 min walk-back recovery.
│
└─ Interval 5: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Sprint (60-100 meters) (last one — commit fully)
   (don't decelerate early — drive through the finish line)
   Rest: 4 min recovery before supplemental work.

Record: time or subjective effort for each sprint.

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟢🧩 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–1)

Two hill sprints to shift the pattern. Hills force you into perfect sprint mechanics — short stride, high knee, forward lean — without coaching. The hill does the coaching.

**Hill Sprint Protocol**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Hill Sprint (Short) (10-15 second effort, sprint to the top)
│  (lean into the hill, drive the knees — the hill forces it)
│  Rest: 3 min walk-down recovery.
│
├─ Set 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Hill Sprint (Short) (match effort of Set 1)
│  (stay on the balls of the feet, don't go heel-strike on the way up)
│  Rest: 3 min walk-down recovery.
│
└─ Set 3: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Hill Sprint (Short) (final set — full effort)
   (elbows back, high knees, don't lean from the waist)
   Rest: 3 min before release.

If no hill is available: substitute 3 × ➖ Jump Rope Sprint Intervals (30 sec max effort, 3 min rest).

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖🟢🪫 (Release | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0)

CNS was fully loaded. Bring it down before you leave.

├─ 5 min ➖ Walking (Zone 2 Heart Rate) (slow pace, breathe out the effort)
├─ Static stretch sequence:
│  ├─ Standing Hamstring Stretch — 45 sec per leg (stand tall, tip forward from the hips)
│  ├─ Standing Quad Stretch — 45 sec per leg (stand on one leg, pull the heel to the glute)
│  ├─ Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) — 60 sec per side (squeeze the glute, find the stretch)
│  └─ Standing Calf Stretch (Gastrocnemius) — 45 sec per leg (heel down, lean into the wall)

Rest: Unhurried. No time pressure here.

## 6. 🚂 JUNCTION

**Session log:**

| Sprint | Distance | Subjective Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 60–100m | /10 | |
| 2 | 60–100m | /10 | |

| 3 | ~10-15 sec | /10 | |

**Surface used:**

**Conditions (weather, footing):**

**Next session bridges:**

Next → ⛽🏛➖🔵 — bring these sprint intervals back onto the erg: structured rowing with fixed splits
Next → ⛽🏛➖🟡 — same bodyweight restriction, add variety: jump rope, shuttle runs, mixed modalities
Next → ⛽🏛➖⚫ — teach the rowing stroke mechanics before running more sprint blocks

## 🧮 SAVE

Sprint speed is a perishable skill. It degrades without consistent exposure. This session is not supplemental to gym work — it is a check on whether the cardiovascular system functions without the machines. Log the surface and the conditions. Repeat.
