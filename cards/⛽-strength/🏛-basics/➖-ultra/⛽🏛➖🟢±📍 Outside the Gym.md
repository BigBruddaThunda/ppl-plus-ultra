> "The most honest test of fitness is what you can do when the equipment is gone."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — joints ready before the sprints hit

- 3 min Walking (easy pace, nasal breathing — no rush)
- Dynamic prep:
  - 10 Walking High Knees (drive the knee to hip height, tall spine)
  - 10 Walking Butt Kicks (heel to glute, stay upright)
  - 10 Walking Lunge with Twist (long stride, rotate over the front knee)
  - 10/leg Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) (hold a wall, full swing range)
  - 10/leg Leg Swings (Lateral) (controlled)
  - 10 Inchworm Walkout (slow, press through the shoulders)
- 2 min Tempo Run (easy jog — not fast yet)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — flat ground, full effort, full recovery. The erg is not here.

Rest: 3–4 min walk-back between sprints.

**5 × Sprint (60–100 meters) — Max Effort**

- Sprint 1: max effort (drive the knees, lean slightly forward from the ankles — not the hips)
- Sprint 2: max effort (arms at 90°, drive back — not across the body)
- Sprint 3: max effort (stay tall in the hips — don't sit down into the stride)
- Sprint 4: max effort (breathe before you go — full inhale, then sprint)
- Sprint 5: max effort (don't decelerate early — drive through the finish)

Log subjective effort for each sprint (/10).

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — hill sprints. The hill does the coaching.

Rest: 3 min walk-down between efforts.

**3 × Hill Sprint (Short) — 10–15 seconds**

The hill forces perfect mechanics: short stride, high knee, forward lean — without any cue needed.

- Set 1: max effort to the top (lean into the hill, drive the knees)
- Set 2: match Set 1 (balls of the feet — don't heel-strike on the way up)
- Set 3: max effort (elbows back, high knees, don't lean from the waist)

If no hill: substitute 3 × Jump Rope Sprint Intervals (30 sec max effort, 3 min rest).

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — CNS was fully loaded. Bring it down.

- 5 min Walking (slow pace, breathe out the effort)
- 45 sec/leg Standing Hamstring Stretch (stand tall, tip forward from the hips)
- 45 sec/leg Standing Quad Stretch (pull heel to glute, stay balanced)
- 60 sec/side Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) (squeeze the glute, find the stretch)
- 45 sec/leg Standing Calf Stretch (Gastrocnemius) (heel down, lean into the wall)

- ⛽🏛➖🔵 — bring the sprint format onto the erg: structured 5 × 500m with fixed splits
- ⛽🏛➖🟡 — same bodyweight restriction with variety: jump rope, shuttles, mixed modalities
- ⛽🏛➖⚫ — learn the rowing stroke mechanics before running more sprint blocks

## 🧮 SAVE

Sprint speed is a perishable skill. It degrades without consistent exposure. This session is not supplemental to gym work — it is a check on whether the cardiovascular system functions without the machines. Log the surface and the conditions. Repeat.
