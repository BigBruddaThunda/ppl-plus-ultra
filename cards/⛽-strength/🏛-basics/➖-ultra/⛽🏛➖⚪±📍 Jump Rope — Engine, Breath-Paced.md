# ➖ Jump Rope — Engine, Breath-Paced ➖

Nasal breathing intervals | 4 × 500m rowing, 2 × tempo run | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➖⚪

> "The pace is set by the breath. If you have to open your mouth, you went too fast."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — calibrate the respiratory system before the work begins

- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 3, 16–18 spm)
  - Breathe only through the nose throughout
  - Find the pace where nasal breathing is possible — if the mouth wants to open, slow down
  - Note the split where nasal breathing breaks down: that is the ceiling for today
- Dynamic prep (breath focus throughout):
  - 10 Walking High Knees (inhale through nose for 2 steps, exhale for 2 steps)
  - 10 Inchworm Walkout (full nasal inhale at the top, exhale on the way down)
  - 10/leg Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) (breathe continuously — no holding)
  - 10 World's Greatest Stretch (hold the bottom for one full breath cycle per rep)
- 3 min Assault Bike (Steady State) (easy cadence — find the nasal-breathing pace on this machine separately)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — two primer intervals. The constraint: nasal breathing throughout.

Rest: 2 min between sets.

- Set 1: Rowing Intervals (500m) — nasal breathing only
  - (find the fastest split where nasal breathing holds for the full 500m — this is likely slower than usual)
  - Note the split. This is the ⚪ nasal-pace reference.

- Set 2: Assault Bike (Steady State) — 2 min at nasal-breathing pace
  - (find the RPM where nasal breathing is comfortable but not effortless)

The intensity is not absent — it is controlled. High output through the nose is harder than high output through the mouth. That is the training stimulus.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — four rowing intervals. Nasal breathing throughout. Full rule: if the mouth opens, rest 30 extra seconds before continuing. Do not chase with mouth breathing.

Rest: 2.5 min between intervals. Breathe through the nose during rest as well.

**4 × Rowing Intervals (500m) — Nasal Breathing, Max Pace That Permits It**

- Interval 1: (4-count inhale on the recovery slide, exhale on the drive finish — find the rhythm; damper 4, 24–26 spm)
- Interval 2: (hold or push slightly — if Interval 1 was sustainable, test the upper edge)
- Interval 3: (midpoint check — if breath is breaking, reduce pace slightly; the back half is where discipline breaks)
- Interval 4: (hold the pace from the previous three — consistency is the metric, not absolute speed)

Split consistency across all four is more important than the absolute pace.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — tempo run: the most natural breathing modality; movement and breath pattern align more easily than on the machine

Rest: 2 min walk recovery between sets. Nasal breathing throughout.

**2 × Tempo Run (Moderate Pace) — 5 minutes**

- Set 1: find the running pace where nasal breathing is possible but not effortless (tall posture, relaxed arms, mid-foot landing — good posture helps the breath)
- Set 2: hold the same pace as Set 1 (not a progression — a repetition; if pace drifts, walk briefly, rebuild)

If treadmill: set the speed at nasal-breathing pace from Set 1 and do not touch the controls.

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — mindful color: tension DOWN, parasympathetic downregulation. 10–15 minutes.

- 5 min Walking (very easy, nasal breathing — 4-count inhale, 6-count exhale)
- 2 min Child's Pose (breathe into the lower back — feel it expand; 4 in, 6 out)
- 90 sec/side Supine Figure-4 Stretch (Glute) (breathe into the hip — exhale lets it open)
- 2 min Seated Forward Fold (exhale deepens the fold — do not force it, let the breath move you)
- 2 min Supine (flat on back, eyes closed — diaphragmatic breathing: belly rises on inhale)

No hurry after this session.

## 🧮 SAVE

The split time where the breath held is a different and more valuable number than your maximum output split. It reflects the health of your aerobic base, not just your pain tolerance. Train both. The gap between them is the size of your aerobic floor.
