# ➖ The Mechanics of Hard Effort ➖

Taught interval structure | Rowing stroke breakdown, 4 × 500m | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➖⚫

> "Learn what maximum effort looks like before you try to sustain it."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — arrive on the machine. Learn the shapes before adding output.

- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 3, 18 spm, nasal breathing — easy pace)
- 3 min Assault Bike (Steady State) (easy pedal, arms and legs, relax the grip)
- Dynamic prep:
  - 10 Walking High Knees (tall spine, drive the knee)
  - 10 Inchworm Walkout (slow, feel the hamstring)
  - 10 World's Greatest Stretch (one rep per side — no rush)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🛠 CRAFT

📍 pono — the rowing stroke in three phases. Comprehension over output. Take all the time each segment needs.

Rest: 90 sec–2 min between sets.

**Phase 1: Legs Only**
- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) — legs only, arms straight
  - (push the floor away — feel the seat move before anything else)
  - After: note where the legs wanted to stop short

**Phase 2: Legs + Lean**
- 3 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) — legs drive, then lean back to 11 o'clock
  - (hips hinge at the finish — not the lower back)
  - After: check if the lean came from the hips or collapsed from the spine

**Phase 3: Full Stroke**
- 3 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) — full stroke at 24 spm
  - (legs, lean, arms — say the sequence, do the sequence)
  - After: name where it breaks down. That is what the next session works.

**Assault Bike Posture Check:**
- 2 min Assault Bike (Steady State) — flat back, push and pull the handles equally
  - (pull the handlebar as hard as you push it — both hands are always working)

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — four working intervals. Each gets one assigned cue focus.

Rest: 4 min full recovery between intervals.

**4 × Rowing Intervals (500m) — Teaching Protocol**

- Interval 1: max effort — Cue Focus: Catch Position
  - (shins vertical, arms straight, sit tall — this is the most powerful position)
  - Record split.

- Interval 2: max effort — Cue Focus: Drive Sequence
  - (legs fire, then lean back, then arms pull — the sequence is everything)
  - Does the split improve when the sequence is right?

- Interval 3: max effort — Cue Focus: Recovery Phase
  - (arms extend first, lean forward second, then slide up — mirror the drive)
  - Is the recovery rushed? A rushed recovery cuts the next drive short.

- Interval 4: max effort — Cue Focus: Full Integration
  - (no single focus — apply all three phases as one unit)
  - This should be the best split of the session.

## 4. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — bring the system down deliberately

- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 2, 18 spm, nasal breathing — no output target)
- 5 min Assault Bike (Steady State) (legs only, slow cadence)
- 60 sec/side Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) (slow exhale at the deepest point)
- 60 sec Seated Forward Fold (let it happen — don't force it)
- 60 sec Child's Pose (breathe into the lower back)

- ⛽🏛➖🔵 — take today's mechanics into a structured 5 × 500m prescription with fixed splits
- ⛽🏛➖🟣 — fewer intervals, extended rest, technical precision under fatigue
- ⛽🏛➖🟢 — same interval structure, no machines: sprints and bodyweight cardio

## 🧮 SAVE

The split you recorded today is a baseline, not a score. Every future session on this machine starts from that number and works outward. The mechanics are the asset — the numbers follow from the mechanics.
