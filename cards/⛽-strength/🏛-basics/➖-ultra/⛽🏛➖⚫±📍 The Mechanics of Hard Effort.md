# ➖ The Mechanics of Hard Effort ➖

**Teaching interval structure | Cardiovascular system | 55–65 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➖⚫

> "Learn what maximum effort feels like before you try to sustain it."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖⚫♨️ (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

You are not warming up to sweat. You are warming up to teach your body the shapes it will hold under load.

├─ 5 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 3, 18 spm, breathe through your nose)
├─ 3 min ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) (easy pedal, arms and legs, relax the grip)
├─ 5 min Dynamic movement prep:
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Walking High Knees (tall spine, drive the knee)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Walking Butt Kicks (heel to glute, stay upright)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Inchworm Walkout (slow, feel the hamstring)
│  └─ 10 ➖ World's Greatest Stretch (one rep per side, no rush)

Rest: None. Continuous flow.

## 2. 🛠 CRAFT

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖⚫🛠 (Craft | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Before intervals, learn the machine. Most people never learn the rowing stroke. This block fixes that. Three cues drive the whole pull: legs, lean, arms. In that order. Always in that order.

**Rowing Stroke Breakdown — Three-Phase Drill**

├─ Phase 1: Legs Only (no arms, no lean)
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 5 min × ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (legs only, arms straight, feel the push)
│  └─ Rest: 90 sec. Coach observes posture at the catch.
│
├─ Phase 2: Legs + Lean (no arm pull yet)
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 3 min × ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (legs drive, lean back to 11 o'clock)
│  └─ Rest: 90 sec. Check: hips hinge at the finish, not the lower back.
│
├─ Phase 3: Full Stroke — Legs, Lean, Arms
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 3 min × ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (24 spm, feel all three phases separate)
│  └─ Rest: 2 min. Debrief: where does it break down?

**Assault Bike Mechanics — Posture Drill**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 2 min × ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) (push and pull the handles, flat back)
│  (pull the handlebar as hard as you push it)
└─ Rest: 90 sec.

Rest: Extended between sets (90 sec–2 min). Comprehension over output here.

## 3. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖⚫▶️ (Primer | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Two build-up efforts. Controlled acceleration. You are teaching the CNS what "go" means before it has to actually go.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) at 75% effort (smooth, not hard — 26 spm max)
│  (long strokes, don't rush the catch)
│  Rest: 3 min. Note your split time.
│
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) at 85% effort (push the stroke rate to 28 spm)
   (stay long, don't chop the stroke short)
   Rest: 3–4 min full recovery before main work.

Cue before the main sets: "Your 100% is not the same as the person next to you. Find yours."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖⚫🧈 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Four working intervals. Extended rest between each. The goal is not high output — it is teaching what high output looks like under observation.

**Teaching Protocol: Each interval has one assigned cue focus.**

├─ Interval 1: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) — Cue Focus: Catch Position
│  (sit tall, shins vertical, arms straight at the catch)
│  Target split: honest max effort, record the number
│  Rest: 4 min full recovery. Coach reviews catch posture.
│
├─ Interval 2: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) — Cue Focus: Drive Sequence
│  (legs first, then lean back, then arms — the sequence is everything)
│  Target split: match or beat Interval 1
│  Rest: 4 min full recovery. Ask: did the sequence break down?
│
├─ Interval 3: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) — Cue Focus: Recovery Phase
│  (arms away first, lean forward second, then slide up — mirror the drive)
│  Target split: match or beat Interval 2
│  Rest: 4 min full recovery. Review: is the recovery rushed?
│
└─ Interval 4: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) — Cue Focus: Full Stroke Integration
   (no single focus — apply all three phases as one unit)
   Target split: best effort of the session
   Rest: 4 min.

Record split times for all four intervals. These are your baseline.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖⚫🪫 (Release | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Bring the system down deliberately. This is not optional — CNS discharge after high-effort intervals is a skill.

├─ 5 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 2, 18 spm, nasal breathing only)
│  (let the split time be whatever it is — no output target)
├─ 5 min ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) (legs only, slow cadence, let the arms rest)
└─ 5 min Static hold sequence:
   ├─ Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) — 60 sec per side (slow exhale at the deepest point)
   ├─ Seated Forward Fold — 60 sec (let it happen, don't force it)
   └─ Child's Pose — 60 sec (breathe into the lower back)

Rest: Continuous, unhurried.

## 6. 🚂 JUNCTION

📍 pono — ⛽🏛➖⚫🚂 (Junction | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

**Session log:**

| Interval | Distance | Split (/500m) | Cue Focus | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 500m | | Catch position | |
| 2 | 500m | | Drive sequence | |
| 3 | 500m | | Recovery phase | |
| 4 | 500m | | Full integration | |

**Primer splits:**

| Set | Distance | Split (/500m) | Effort % |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primer 1 | 500m | | 75% |
| Primer 2 | 500m | | 85% |

**What broke down today:**

**What held together:**

**Next session bridges:**

Next → ⛽🏛➖🔵 — take today's mechanics and put them into a structured interval prescription with fixed splits
Next → ⛽🏛➖🟣 — fewer intervals, extended rest, technical precision under fatigue
Next → ⛽🏛➖🟢 — same interval structure, no machines: sprints and bodyweight cardio

## 🧮 SAVE

The split time you recorded today is a baseline, not a score. Every future session on this machine starts from that number and works outward. The mechanics are the asset — the numbers follow from the mechanics.
