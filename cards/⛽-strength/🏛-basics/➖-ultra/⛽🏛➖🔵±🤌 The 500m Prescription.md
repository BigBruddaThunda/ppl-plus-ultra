# ➖ The 500m Prescription ➖

**Prescribed rowing intervals | Cardiovascular system | 50–60 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🔵

> "Five intervals. Three minutes between them. Everything else is just noise."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔵♨️ (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Get the system moving. Damper down, stroke rate low, no ambition yet.

├─ 5 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 3, 18 spm, focus on the stroke sequence)
│  (legs, lean, arms — say it to yourself as you row)
├─ 3 min ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) (steady pedal, easy output, no forcing)
└─ Dynamic prep:
   ├─ 10 ➖ Walking Lunge with Twist (reach the arm overhead over the front knee)
   ├─ 10 ➖ Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) per leg (full range, controlled)
   ├─ 10 ➖ Inchworm Walkout (slow, feel the hamstrings lengthen)
   └─ 10 ➖ World's Greatest Stretch (one rep each side, full rotation at the top)

Rest: None. Flow through warm-up continuously.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔵▶️ (Primer | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Two sub-maximal rows to prime the CNS and establish your working pace.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) at 80% effort
│  (set the damper to your working position — 4 or 5 is standard)
│  (note the split: this is your 80% reference)
│  Rest: 3 min. Log the split.
│
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) at 90% effort
   (push into the discomfort, hold good form through the last 150m)
   (note the split: this is your 90% reference)
   Rest: 3 min full recovery before the main block.

Target splits are personal. The number on the screen is yours alone. Log it.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔵🧈 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Five rounds. Max effort per interval. Full recovery between. This is the classic ⛽ conditioning benchmark on the erg — the 5 × 500m. The split time is the score. The protocol is fixed.

**5 × 500m Rowing — Max Effort Per Interval**

├─ Interval 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (sit tall at the catch, legs fire first, don't overgrip the handle)
│  Target: match or exceed your 90% primer split
│  Rest: 3 min. Record split.
│
├─ Interval 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (damper stays fixed — don't adjust mid-session)
│  (hold your pace through the middle 200m — that's where it falls apart)
│  Rest: 3 min. Record split.
│
├─ Interval 3: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (breathe on the recovery, not the drive — keep the mouth closed on the pull)
│  Rest: 3 min. Record split.
│
├─ Interval 4: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (this is the decision interval — hold the split or let it slip)
│  (lean slightly earlier on the recovery to protect the lower back)
│  Rest: 3 min. Record split.
│
└─ Interval 5: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
   (last one — go through the finish, not to it)
   (drive from the legs, don't pull with the arms early)
   Rest: 4 min before supplemental block.

**Session split target:** Within 3–4 seconds of Interval 1 across all five. If the drift exceeds 5 seconds, the recovery was too short or the effort was too high on Interval 1.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔵🧩 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–4)

Shift the demand to the assault bike. Different muscle recruitment pattern. Same interval structure. Shorter work period to match the cardiovascular challenge.

**3 × Assault Bike Intervals**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) — 30 sec on, 30 sec off
│  (arms and legs both drive — don't let the legs coast while the arms pull)
│  Rest: 3 min full recovery after the 30/30 sequence.
│
├─ Set 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) — 30 sec on, 30 sec off
│  (flat back, push the pedals down and pull them up)
│  Rest: 3 min full recovery.
│
└─ Set 3: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) — 30 sec on, 30 sec off
   (hold form through the second half of each 30-second effort)
   Rest: 3 min before release.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔵🪫 (Release | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

The body is done. Discharge the accumulated stress before leaving.

├─ 5 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 2, 16–18 spm, no output pressure)
│  (arms only — full stroke but soft legs — let the upper body cool down)
├─ Static stretch sequence:
│  ├─ Seated Forward Fold — 60 sec (let the back decompress after the rowing)
│  ├─ Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) — 60 sec per side (the hip flexors worked hard)
│  ├─ Child's Pose — 60 sec (breathe into the thoracic spine)
│  └─ Cat-Cow Stretch — 10 slow cycles (move vertebra by vertebra)

Rest: Unhurried. Take the full time.

## 6. 🚂 JUNCTION

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔵🚂 (Junction | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

**Session log — 5 × 500m:**

| Interval | Split (/500m) | Damper | Avg Watts | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primer 80% | | | | |
| Primer 90% | | | | |
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

**Assault Bike supplemental:**

| Set | Peak RPM (approx.) | Effort | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | /10 | |
| 2 | | /10 | |
| 3 | | /10 | |

**Split consistency (best – worst):**

**Next session bridges:**

Next → ⛽🏛➖🟣 — same erg work, fewer intervals, full rest, precision focus on stroke quality
Next → ⛽🏛➖🔴 — more intervals, less rest, maximum cardiovascular demand
Next → ⛽🏛➖⚫ — if mechanics felt rough on Intervals 3–5, go back and teach the stroke

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 🧮 SAVE

The 5 × 500m is a benchmark. Run it every 4–6 weeks on the same damper setting. The split trends tell you whether the engine is growing. Everything else is supporting evidence.
