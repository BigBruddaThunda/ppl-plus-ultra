# ➖ The 500m Prescription ➖

Prescribed rowing intervals | 5 × 500m + bike supplemental | 50–60 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🔵

> "Five intervals. Three minutes between them. Everything else is noise."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — system moving, stroke rate low, no ambition yet

- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 3, 18 spm — legs, lean, arms, say it while you row)
- 3 min Assault Bike (Steady State) (steady pedal, easy output)
- Dynamic prep:
  - 10 Walking Lunge with Twist
  - 10/leg Leg Swings (Forward/Backward)
  - 10 Inchworm Walkout
  - 10 World's Greatest Stretch (one per side)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — two sub-maximal rows to establish working pace and log the reference

Rest: 3 min between sets.

- Set 1: Rowing Intervals (500m) at 80% effort (damper 4–5 — note the split)
- Set 2: Rowing Intervals (500m) at 90% effort (push into the discomfort, hold form through the last 150m — note the split)

These splits are personal. The number on the screen is yours alone.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — execute. Log every split.

Rest: 3 min between intervals. Fixed. Do not shorten.

**5 × Rowing Intervals (500m) — Max Effort Per Interval**

- Interval 1: max effort (sit tall at the catch, legs fire first — set the reference split)
- Interval 2: max effort (damper stays fixed — don't adjust mid-session; hold the middle 200m)
- Interval 3: max effort (breathe on the recovery, not the drive — mouth closed on the pull)
- Interval 4: max effort (decision interval — hold the split or let it slip; choose to hold it)
- Interval 5: max effort (go through the finish, not to it — drive from the legs last)

**Split consistency target:** Within 3–4 seconds of Interval 1 across all five. If drift exceeds 5 seconds, the rest was too short or Interval 1 was too fast.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — shift to assault bike, same interval structure

Rest: 3 min full recovery after each set.

**3 × Assault Bike Intervals (30 sec on / 30 sec off)**

- Set 1: max effort × 30 sec (arms and legs simultaneously — don't let legs coast while arms pull)
- Set 2: max effort × 30 sec (flat back, push pedals down and pull them up)
- Set 3: max effort × 30 sec (hold form through the second half of each effort)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — the body is done. Discharge before leaving.

- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 2, 16–18 spm — no output pressure, arms only)
- 60 sec Seated Forward Fold (back decompresses after the rowing position)
- 60 sec/side Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) (hip flexors worked hard)
- 60 sec Child's Pose (breathe into the thoracic spine)
- 10 slow Cat-Cow cycles

## 🧮 SAVE

The 5 × 500m is a benchmark. Run it every 4–6 weeks on the same damper setting. The split trends tell you whether the engine is growing. Everything else is supporting evidence.
