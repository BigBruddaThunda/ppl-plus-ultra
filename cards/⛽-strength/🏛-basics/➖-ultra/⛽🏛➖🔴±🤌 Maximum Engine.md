CODE: ⛽🏛➖🔴

> "The hardest session in this deck. Every interval is a full commitment."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — 15 minutes minimum. The demand ahead requires it.

- 3 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 3, 18 spm, nasal breathing)
- 3 min Assault Bike (Steady State) (easy cadence, hips and shoulders warm)
- Dynamic prep:
  - 10 Inchworm Walkout
  - 10 Walking Lunge with Twist
  - 10/leg Leg Swings (Forward/Backward)
  - 10 World's Greatest Stretch (one per side, hold at top)
- 3 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 4, 22 spm — step up slightly)
- 3 min Assault Bike (Steady State) (harder, still below working intensity)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — open the CNS before the main block

Rest: 2 min between primer efforts.

- Rowing Sprints (250m) at 85% effort (26 spm, controlled — find pace, not ceiling)
- Assault Bike Sprints (20 sec) at max effort (full arms and legs simultaneously — don't coast)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — 7 × 500m. Reduced rest. The split will degrade. Minimize the degradation.

Rest: 90 sec between intervals. 🔴 Intense — rest is halved from the structured prescription.

**7 × Rowing Intervals (500m) — Max Effort**

- Interval 1: max effort (establish the reference split — damper 4–5, 28–30 spm)
- Interval 2: max effort (hold within 2 sec of Interval 1 — 90 sec is not full recovery)
- Interval 3: max effort (stay calm — the body knows the rest is short, don't panic)
- Interval 4: max effort (midpoint — if split drift exceeds 4 sec, open pace slightly for the back half)
- Interval 5: max effort (legs drive first — no arm-pulling early)
- Interval 6: max effort (two left — full commitment to each remaining interval)
- Interval 7: max effort (empty the tank — drive through the finish, not to it)

Record all 7 splits. Rest 4 min before the Gutter.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🌋 GUTTER

🤌 facio — what is left after the interval block. One all-out effort.

Rest: 4 min full before starting. No compromising this rest.

**Assault Bike Calories (For Time) — 30 calories**

- Full arms and legs from the first pedal stroke — no build-in
- Lean forward slightly, push down and pull up with equal force
- 30 calories at max effort: approximately 45–75 seconds
- Log time.

If the 7 × 500m took significant toll and form is degrading: skip the Gutter and proceed to supplemental.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — jump rope: different pattern, same output ceiling

Rest: 60 sec between sets.

**3 × Jump Rope Sprint Intervals (30 sec on / 60 sec rest)**

- Set 1: max effort (fast feet, soft knees — land on balls of the feet)
- Set 2: max effort (wrists do the turning, not the shoulders — small circles)
- Set 3: max effort (feet moving fast even as the arms tire)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — intense color: stress goes OUT, not gently down

- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 1–2, 16 spm — decompression, not training)
- 3 min Walking (slow, breathe through the nose)
- 60 sec Seated Forward Fold (posterior chain decompresses)
- 60 sec Child's Pose (thoracic decompression)
- 60 sec/side Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) (hip flexors drove today's power)
- 60 sec/side Supine Figure-4 Stretch (Glute)

## 🧮 SAVE

Seven intervals at 90 seconds rest is a different physiological stimulus than five at 3 minutes. The adaptation is not speed — it is speed under accumulated fatigue. Both need to be trained. This session trains the second one.
