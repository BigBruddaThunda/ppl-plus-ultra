# ➖ Maximum Engine ➖

**Maximum cardiovascular output | Cardiovascular system | 60–70 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🔴

> "The hardest session in this deck. Every interval is a full commitment."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔴♨️ (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–4)

The demand ahead is maximum cardiovascular output. The warm-up is not optional and not abbreviated. You need 15 minutes minimum to prepare the system for what comes next.

├─ 3 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 3, 18 spm, nasal breathing — easy pace)
├─ 3 min ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) (easy cadence, get the hips and shoulders warm)
├─ Dynamic prep:
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Inchworm Walkout (hamstrings and shoulders — both will work today)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Walking Lunge with Twist (hip flexors and thoracic mobility)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) per leg (full range)
│  └─ 10 ➖ World's Greatest Stretch (one per side — long hold at the top)
├─ 3 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 4, 22 spm — step up the output slightly)
└─ 3 min ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) (pedal harder, still below working intensity)

Rest: None. The warm-up is the first 15 minutes of this session.

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔴▶️ (Primer | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–4)

Two sharp escalation efforts to open the CNS before the main block.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Sprints (250m) at 85% effort
│  (26 spm, controlled — find your pace, not your ceiling)
│  Rest: 2 min.
│
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Assault Bike Sprints (10-30 seconds) — 20 sec, max legs + arms
   (full commitment — push and pull simultaneously, don't coast)
   Rest: 2 min before main work.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔴🧈 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–4)

The main block. Seven 500m rowing intervals. Reduced rest — 90 seconds between rounds. This is the difference between ⛽🔵 and ⛽🔴: the work volume doubles and the rest cuts in half. The CNS demand is maximum. The split will degrade. Your job is to minimize the degradation.

**7 × 500m Rowing — Max Effort, 90 sec Rest**

├─ Interval 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (establish the target split — this is your reference)
│  (damper 4–5, 28–30 spm, full leg drive)
│  Rest: 90 sec.
│
├─ Interval 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (hold within 2 sec of Interval 1 — 90 sec is not enough to fully recover)
│  (breathe out completely on the recovery phase — don't hold CO2)
│  Rest: 90 sec.
│
├─ Interval 3: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (the body knows it's not getting enough rest — stay calm, don't panic)
│  (shorten the stroke if you have to, but keep the rate up)
│  Rest: 90 sec.
│
├─ Interval 4: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (midpoint — assess the split drift, adjust the opening pace for the back half if needed)
│  Rest: 90 sec.
│
├─ Interval 5: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (hold the technique — legs drive first, no arm-pulling early)
│  Rest: 90 sec.
│
├─ Interval 6: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
│  (two left — commit fully to each remaining interval)
│  Rest: 90 sec.
│
└─ Interval 7: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)
   (last one — empty the tank)
   (drive through the finish, not to it)
   Rest: 4 min before the Gutter.

Record all 7 splits.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🌋 GUTTER

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔴🌋 (Gutter | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–4)

One final all-out effort after the interval block. This is not a supplemental set. This is the residual — what you have left when the structured work is done. The Gutter is rare. It belongs here.

**1 × Assault Bike Calories (For Time) — 30 calories, max speed**

├─ Start: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Assault Bike Calories (For Time) — 30 calories
│  (full arms and legs from the first pedal stroke — no build-in)
│  (lean forward slightly, push the pedals down hard, pull the handlebars hard)
│  (30 calories at max effort takes approximately 45–75 seconds)
└─ Record time.

Rest: 4 min after the Gutter before supplemental work.

If the 7 × 500m took significant toll and form is degrading, skip the Gutter and go to supplemental.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔴🧩 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–2)

Jump rope. Low equipment, high cardiovascular demand, different pattern from seated cardio. GOLD gate does not apply here — jump rope is Tier 1, not GOLD.

**3 × Jump Rope Sprint Intervals**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Jump Rope Sprint Intervals — 30 sec on, 60 sec rest
│  (fast feet, soft knees — land on the balls of the feet)
│  Rest: 60 sec.
│
├─ Set 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Jump Rope Sprint Intervals — 30 sec on, 60 sec rest
│  (wrists do the turning, not the shoulders — small circles)
│  Rest: 60 sec.
│
└─ Set 3: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Jump Rope Sprint Intervals — 30 sec on
   (last push — keep the feet moving fast even as the arms tire)
   Rest: 3 min before release.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🔴🪫 (Release | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Intense color: 🪫 Release is cathartic discharge. The stress goes OUT. Not down gently — out deliberately.

├─ 5 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 1–2, 16 spm — let the heart rate drop)
│  (this is decompression, not training — no pace target)
├─ 3 min ➖ Walking (Zone 2 Heart Rate) (slow walk, breathe through the nose)
└─ Static sequence:
   ├─ Seated Forward Fold — 60 sec (the row taxes the posterior chain heavily)
   ├─ Child's Pose — 60 sec (thoracic decompression)
   ├─ Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) — 60 sec per side (hip flexors drove today's power)
   └─ Supine Figure-4 Stretch (Glute) — 60 sec per side (lat pull of the rowing loads the hips)

Rest: Take all the time this block demands. The work is done.

**Gutter result:**

| Effort | Calories | Time | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Assault Bike Calories | 30 | | |

**Next session bridges:**

Next → ⛽🏛➖🔵 — same erg format, more rest: 5 × 500m at 3 min between
Next → ⛽🏛➖🟣 — fewer intervals, full recovery, precision focus on each stroke
Next → ⛽🏛➖🟢 — take the sprint format outside: track sprints with full walk recovery

## 🧮 SAVE

Seven intervals at reduced rest is a different physiological stimulus than five at full rest. The adaptation is not speed — it is speed under accumulated fatigue. Both need to be trained. This session trains the second one.
