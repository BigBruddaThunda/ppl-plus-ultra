# ➖ Precision at Output ➖

Technical interval conditioning | 3 × 1000m rowing, sled supplemental | 55–70 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🟣

> "Three intervals. Full recovery. Every stroke counts."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — position before output. The warm-up establishes the stroke you will hold under fatigue.

- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 4, 18 spm)
  - Catch: shins vertical, arms straight, body at 1 o'clock
  - Drive: legs, then lean, then arms — no exceptions
  - Finish: lean at 11 o'clock, handle below sternum
  - Recovery: arms first, lean forward second, then slide — mirror the drive
- Dynamic prep:
  - 10 Inchworm Walkout (hamstring flexibility limits the catch — feel it)
  - 10 World's Greatest Stretch (thoracic rotation — needed for the finish position)
  - 10/leg Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) (hip flexors for the catch)
  - 10 Cat-Cow (lumbar awareness — protect the lower back at the finish)
- 3 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 4, 20 spm — step up the rate, hold the form)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — calibration intervals, not warm-up efforts

Rest: 4–5 min between sets.

- Set 1: Rowing Intervals (1000m) at controlled output
  - (target: 2K race pace minus 3–4 sec per 500m — settle at 26–28 spm)
  - Note the average split. Did stroke rate stay consistent? Did form hold through 800m?

- Set 2: Rowing Sprints (250m) — max effort, technical focus
  - (28–32 spm, full leg drive, no slouching at the finish)
  - This is the top-end reference. Log it.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — three hard intervals. The technical focus rotates. You are not just rowing — you are examining your output under fatigue.

Rest: 5 min full recovery between intervals. 🟣 Technical — the rest is mandatory.

**3 × Rowing Intervals (1000m) — Technical Focus Per Interval**

- Interval 1: max effort — Focus: Stroke Rate Control
  - (26 spm for first 500m, build to 28 spm for second 500m)
  - (rate creeping up early means the legs are doing less — resist it)

- Interval 2: max effort — Focus: Drive Power Per Stroke
  - (aim for higher watts per stroke, not higher rate — fewer, heavier strokes)
  - (feel the difference between a 26 spm heavy stroke and a 30 spm light one)

- Interval 3: max effort — Focus: Full Integration
  - (apply rate control from Interval 1 and drive power from Interval 2)
  - (this should be the best interval — both variables working at once)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — sled push: linear ground force, different pattern from the erg

Rest: 4 min between sets.

**3 × Sled Push (Heavy) — 20 meters**

- Set 1: controlled pace (lean into the handles, full extension at the hip — don't shuffle)
- Set 2: same load (maintain the lean angle throughout — don't stand up mid-push)
- Set 3: breathe before you start (inhale, then push — don't hold the breath through it)

If no sled: substitute 3 × Rowing Sprints (250m) at max effort, 4 min rest.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — three 1000m intervals and sled is significant CNS load. The release must be deliberate.

- 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 2, 16 spm — flush, not training)
- 60 sec Seated Forward Fold (lumbar and hamstring decompression)
- 90 sec/side Pigeon Pose (Hip External Rotation) (sled loads hip flexors hard)
- 60 sec Child's Pose (let the thoracic spine open)
- 5/side Thread the Needle (30 sec hold each — thoracic rotation recovery)

## 🧮 SAVE

Technical conditioning is a different skill than conditioning. The adaptation you are pursuing is the ability to execute a complex motor pattern at high output under fatigue. That skill has a floor. This session trains the floor.
