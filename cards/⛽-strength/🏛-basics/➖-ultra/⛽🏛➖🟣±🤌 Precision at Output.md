# ➖ Precision at Output ➖

**Technical interval conditioning | Cardiovascular system | 55–70 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🟣

> "Three intervals. Full recovery. Every stroke counts."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟣♨️ (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–5)

Technical color means precision before effort. The warm-up teaches you the exact body position you will maintain under load.

├─ 5 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 4, 18 spm — establish the stroke you intend to hold)
│  (catch: shins vertical, arms straight, body at 1 o'clock)
│  (drive: legs, then lean, then arms — no exceptions)
│  (finish: lean at 11 o'clock, handle below the sternum, elbows past the body)
│  (recovery: arms extend first, then lean forward, then slide — mirror the drive)
├─ 5 min Dynamic prep:
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Inchworm Walkout (slow, assess hamstring flexibility — it limits the catch)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ World's Greatest Stretch (thoracic rotation — you need it for the finish position)
│  ├─ 10 ➖ Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) per leg (loosen the hip flexors for the catch position)
│  └─ 10 ➖ Cat-Cow Stretch (lumbar awareness — protect the lower back in the finish position)
└─ 3 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 4, 20 spm — step up the stroke rate, hold the form)

Rest: None. Quality of movement is the metric in this block.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟣▶️ (Primer | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–5)

Two progressive intervals to find the working pace. These are not warm-up efforts — they are calibration.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Intervals (1000m) at controlled output
│  (target: find your 2K race pace minus 3–4 seconds per 500m)
│  (count strokes per minute: settle at 26–28 spm)
│  (note the average split — this is your technical baseline)
│  Rest: 4 min. Review: did the stroke rate stay consistent? Did the form hold through 800m?
│
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Rowing Sprints (250m) — max effort, technical focus
   (28–32 spm, every stroke explosive, full leg drive, no slouching at the finish)
   (note the split: this is your top-end reference)
   Rest: 4–5 min full recovery before main work.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟣🧈 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–5)

Three hard intervals. 1000m each. Full recovery between. The technical focus rotates per interval — you are not just rowing, you are examining your output under fatigue.

**3 × 1000m Rowing — Technical Focus Per Interval**

├─ Interval 1: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (1000m) — Focus: Stroke Rate Control
│  (target spm: 26 spm for the first 500m, build to 28 spm for the second 500m)
│  (don't let the rate creep up early — control is the technical metric here)
│  (note split, note average spm)
│  Rest: 5 min. Review: did the rate stay controlled in the first half?
│
├─ Interval 2: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (1000m) — Focus: Drive Power Per Stroke
│  (aim for higher watts per stroke, not higher rate — fewer, heavier strokes)
│  (feel the difference between a 26-spm heavy stroke and a 30-spm light stroke)
│  (note average watts)
│  Rest: 5 min. Review: did each stroke feel like a full leg press?
│
└─ Interval 3: ⛽ max effort × ➖ Rowing Intervals (1000m) — Focus: Full Integration
   (apply stroke rate control from Interval 1, drive power from Interval 2)
   (this is your best interval — both variables working together)
   (note split, spm, watts)
   Rest: 5 min before supplemental.

The goal is not to match your fastest 500m split. The goal is to maintain technical form across 1000m at high output.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟣🧩 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–4)

Sled push. Technical conditioning that doesn't compete with the erg in CNS demand — it complements it by shifting the pattern to linear ground force.

**Sled Push Protocol — Force Application Focus**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Sled Push (Heavy) — 20 meters at controlled pace
│  (lean into the handles, full triple extension at the hip — don't shuffle)
│  (push the ground away with each step, not just lean and stumble forward)
│  Rest: 4 min. Note: did the hips stay high, or did they sink?
│
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Sled Push (Heavy) — 20 meters
│  (maintain the same lean angle throughout — don't stand up mid-push)
│  Rest: 4 min.
│
└─ Set 3: ⛽ 1 × ➖ Sled Push (Heavy) — 20 meters
   (breathe: inhale before you start, exhale through the push, don't hold it)
   Rest: 4 min before release.

If no sled is available: substitute 3 × ➖ Rowing Sprints (250m) at max effort, 4 min rest.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟣🪫 (Release | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Three hard 1000m intervals and sled work is significant CNS load. The release must be deliberate.

├─ 5 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 2, 16 spm, no pace target — just flush)
│  (this is not training, it is clearing)
├─ Static stretch sequence:
│  ├─ Seated Forward Fold — 60 sec (lumbar and hamstring decompression)
│  ├─ Pigeon Pose (Hip External Rotation) — 90 sec per side (hip flexors worked hard on the sled)
│  ├─ Child's Pose — 60 sec (let the thoracic spine open)
│  └─ Thread the Needle (Thoracic Rotation) — 5 reps per side (30 sec hold each)

Rest: Take the full time. Do not rush the release after a technical session.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🚂 JUNCTION

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟣🚂 (Junction | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 2–5)

**Session log — 3 × 1000m:**

| Interval | Split (/500m) | Avg SPM | Avg Watts | Focus | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primer 1000m | | | | Calibration | |
| Primer 250m | | | | Max rate | |
| 1 | | | | Stroke rate control | |
| 2 | | | | Drive power | |
| 3 | | | | Full integration | |

**Sled sets:**

| Set | Distance | Load | Form note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 20m | | |
| 2 | 20m | | |
| 3 | 20m | | |

**Technical observation — what degraded under fatigue:**

**Next session bridges:**

Next → ⛽🏛➖🔵 — same erg anchor, higher volume: 5 × 500m with 3 min rest
Next → ⛽🏛➖🔴 — maximum volume and effort, less recovery
Next → ⛽🏛➖⚫ — if stroke mechanics degraded late, return to the teaching session

## 🧮 SAVE

Technical conditioning is a different skill than conditioning. The adaptation you are pursuing is not just cardiovascular — it is the ability to execute a complex motor pattern at high output under fatigue. That skill has a floor. This session trains the floor.
