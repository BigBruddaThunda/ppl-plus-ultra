Station-based conditioning | Rowing, bike, jump rope, sled | 50–60 min

> "Four stations. No barbells. One cardiovascular system. Each station lets the others recover."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — full body ready before the first station

- 5 min continuous:
  - 2 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (easy, damper 3, nasal breathing)
  - 1 min Jump Rope (Steady State) (easy bounce, find the wrist rhythm)
  - 2 min Walking (reset the breath before the circuit starts)
- Dynamic prep:
  - 10 Inchworm Walkout
  - 10 Walking High Knees
  - 10/leg Leg Swings (Forward/Backward)
  - 10 Arm Circles (Forward) + 10 Arm Circles (Backward)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — one pass at 70% through all four stations. Learn the transitions before going full.

30 sec per station. 60 sec rest between stations.

- Station A: Rowing Machine (Steady State) at 70% (feel the transition point — where do you start and stop?)
- Station B: Assault Bike (Steady State) at 70% (easy pedal, feel the machine)
- Station C: Jump Rope (Steady State) at easy pace (find the rhythm — not a sprint yet)
- Station D: Sled Push (Light) at 70% (short push — light load, learn the lean angle)

Rest: 2 min after the primer pass. Adjust station spacing if needed.

## 3. 🎱 ARAM

🤌 facio — tissue rotation loop. Each station lets the previous one recover.

**Loop Logic:**
- Station A (Rowing): upper body pull-dominant, seated
- Station B (Assault Bike): total body push-pull, seated
- Station C (Jump Rope): lower body impact, standing
- Station D (Sled Push): total body push, ground-based linear force

Each station lets the previous tissue recover. Rowing → Bike keeps the seat but switches from pull to push. Bike → Jump Rope shifts from seated to standing. Jump Rope → Sled shifts from impact to drive force. Sled → Rowing returns to seated pull.

```
Station A     Station B     Station C     Station D
Rowing Erg    Assault Bike  Jump Rope     Sled Push
40 sec work   40 sec work   40 sec work   40 sec work
→ 20 sec transition between each station →
Complete 5 rounds. Rest 2 min between rounds if needed.
```

**Station cues:**
- Station A: damper 4, 28 spm — legs first every stroke
- Station B: arms and legs simultaneously — equal push and pull
- Station C: fast feet, soft landing — consistent rhythm, not just speed
- Station D: lean forward, drive with legs, stay off the heels

Rest between rounds: 2 min. Avoid seated rest within rounds.

Loop tissue audit: pull (seated) → push/pull (seated) → lower leg impact (standing) → linear drive (standing) → confirmed rotation, no two adjacent stations match.

## 4. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — five full rounds of a 4-station circuit. Bring it down systematically.

- 5 min Walking (slow — let the heart rate fall on its own)
- 3 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 1, 16 spm, no output target)
- 45 sec/leg Standing Hamstring Stretch (jump rope and sled both load the posterior chain)
- 45 sec/leg Standing Calf Stretch (Gastrocnemius) (jump rope is calf-intensive)
- 60 sec/side Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) (sled push loads hip flexors)
- 60 sec Child's Pose (thoracic decompression after the rowing position)

## 🧮 SAVE

A circuit is not a random sequence of hard things. Each station exists because it allows the previous station's tissue to recover while a different tissue works. The loop logic is the training mechanism — not the timing, not the sweat. The station that fatigued first is where structural work is needed.
