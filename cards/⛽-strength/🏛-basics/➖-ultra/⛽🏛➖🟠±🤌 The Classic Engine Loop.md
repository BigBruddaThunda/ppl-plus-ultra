# ➖ The Classic Engine Loop ➖

**Station-based conditioning circuit | Cardiovascular system | 50–60 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➖🟠

> "Four stations. No barbells. One cardiovascular system. Each station lets the others recover."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟠♨️ (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–3)

Circuit work requires the full body ready before the first station. Warm up every system that will be loaded.

├─ 5 min continuous movement sequence:
│  ├─ 2 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (easy pace, damper 3, breathe through the nose)
│  ├─ 1 min ➖ Jump Rope (Steady State) (easy bounce, wrists loose, find the rhythm)
│  └─ 2 min ➖ Walking (Zone 2 Heart Rate) (reset the breathing before the circuit begins)
└─ Dynamic prep:
   ├─ 10 ➖ Inchworm Walkout (hamstrings and shoulder flexion)
   ├─ 10 ➖ Walking High Knees (hip flexors and coordination)
   ├─ 10 ➖ Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) per leg (hip range)
   └─ 10 ➖ Arm Circles (Forward) + 10 ➖ Arm Circles (Backward) (shoulder prep for the rower)

Rest: None. Continuous movement.

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟠▶️ (Primer | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–3)

One pass through the circuit at reduced intensity. Learn the transitions before you go full effort.

├─ Station A: 30 sec ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) at 70% effort (feel the transition point — where do you start and stop?)
│  Transition: stand, move to Station B.
├─ Station B: 30 sec ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) at 70% effort (easy pedal, feel the machine)
│  Transition: step off, move to Station C.
├─ Station C: 30 sec ➖ Jump Rope (Steady State) at easy pace (find the rhythm — not a sprint yet)
│  Transition: set rope down, move to Station D.
├─ Station D: 30 sec ➖ Sled Push (Light/Fast) at 70% effort (short, quick push — light load)
│  Transition: walk back, set up for the next round.

Rest: 2 min after the primer pass. Adjust station order or spacing if needed.

## 3. 🎱 ARAM

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟠🎱 (ARAM | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–3)

Four stations. Each station trains a different cardiovascular demand pattern. No two adjacent stations target the same tissue. This is not a list of exercises done quickly — it is a deliberate tissue-rotation loop.

**Loop Logic:**
- Station A (Rowing): upper body pull-dominant, seated, bilateral
- Station B (Assault Bike): total body push-pull, seated, simultaneous upper/lower
- Station C (Jump Rope): lower body impact, standing, bilateral
- Station D (Sled Push): total body push, standing, ground-based linear force

Each station lets the previous station's primary tissue recover. Rowing → Bike switches from pull to push but keeps the seat. Bike → Jump rope shifts from seated to standing. Jump rope → Sled shifts from impact to drive force. Sled → Rowing shifts from standing push to seated pull.

**Station Timing: 40 sec work, 20 sec transition (move to next station)**
**Complete 5 rounds of the full loop.**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STATION A          STATION B          STATION C   STATION D    │
│  Rowing Erg         Assault Bike       Jump Rope   Sled Push    │
│  40 sec max effort  40 sec max effort  40 sec      40 sec       │
│  (pull dominant)    (push/pull total)  (lower leg  (ground push │
│                                        impact)     force)       │
│  → 20 sec move →   → 20 sec move →   → 20 sec →  → 20 sec →   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Round 1:**
├─ Station A: ⛽ max effort × 40 sec ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State)
│  (damper 4, 28 spm — push it from the start)
│  (legs first — every stroke, legs first)
│  Transition: 20 sec to Station B.
├─ Station B: ⛽ max effort × 40 sec ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State)
│  (arms and legs simultaneously — don't let either coast)
│  (flat back, push the pedals and pull the bars with equal force)
│  Transition: 20 sec to Station C.
├─ Station C: ⛽ max effort × 40 sec ➖ Jump Rope (Steady State)
│  (fast feet — aim for consistent rhythm, not just speed)
│  (land on the balls of the feet, soft knees)
│  Transition: 20 sec to Station D.
└─ Station D: ⛽ max effort × 40 sec ➖ Sled Push (Light/Fast)
   (lean forward, drive with the legs, stay off the heels)
   (push the ground away — this is force application, not walking)
   Transition: 20 sec to Station A.

**Rounds 2–5: Repeat the same pattern.**

Cues by round:
- Round 2: (hold the effort from Round 1 — don't let the output drop)
- Round 3: (midpoint — breathe on the transitions, not during the work)
- Round 4: (the jump rope will feel hardest now — stay consistent, don't flail)
- Round 5: (last round — commit to every station)

Rest: No seated rest between stations during rounds. 2 min seated rest between rounds 3 and 4 if needed — this is the only permitted break. Avoid it if possible.

## 4. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟠🪫 (Release | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–3)

After 5 rounds of a 4-station circuit the heart rate is elevated and the total-body demand has been high. Bring it down systematically.

├─ 5 min ➖ Walking (Zone 2 Heart Rate) (slow pace — let the heart rate fall on its own)
│  (don't force it down — just keep moving slowly)
├─ 3 min ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) (damper 1, 16 spm, no output target)
└─ Static sequence:
   ├─ Standing Hamstring Stretch — 45 sec per leg (jump rope and sled both load the posterior chain)
   ├─ Standing Calf Stretch (Gastrocnemius) — 45 sec per leg (jump rope is calf-intensive)
   ├─ Hip Flexor Stretch (Half-Kneeling) — 60 sec per side (the sled push loads hip flexors)
   └─ Child's Pose — 60 sec (let the thoracic spine decompress after the rowing position)

Rest: Unhurried.

## 5. 🚂 JUNCTION

🤌 facio — ⛽🏛➖🟠🚂 (Junction | Cardiovascular System | Basics | Tier 0–3)

**Circuit log — 5 rounds:**

| Round | Rowing Output | Bike Output | Jump Rope Notes | Sled Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Primer | easy | easy | easy | easy |
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |

**Output consistency (did the effort hold across all 5 rounds?):**

**Weakest station (which one fell apart first):**

**Next session bridges:**

Next → ⛽🏛➖🔴 — same modalities, no circuit structure: straight intervals on the erg with reduced rest
Next → ⛽🏛➖🟡 — circuit format with more variety and mixed modalities
Next → ⛽🏛➖🔵 — take the erg work into a structured 5 × 500m format with full rest

## 🧮 SAVE

A circuit is not a random sequence of hard things. Each station exists because it allows the previous station's tissue to recover while a different tissue works. That structure is what makes it a circuit — not the timing, not the sweat. The loop logic is the training mechanism. Repeat this session to improve station-to-station efficiency.
