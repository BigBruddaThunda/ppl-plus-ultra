# 🛒 Push Circuit — Rotational Strength Loop 🛒

**Station-based push strength | Chest, front delts, triceps | 55–65 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛🛒🟠

> "Each station recovers what the last one worked. The loop is the logic."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — prepare all push tissue before the circuit begins

⛽🏛🛒🟠♨️ (Warm-Up | Chest/Delts/Triceps | Basics | Tier 0–2)

Rest: Move continuously.

├─ Shoulder mobility:
│  ├─ 10 Shoulder Dislocations (Band/PVC) (slow, full arc)
│  ├─ 15 Band Pull-Apart (retract hard at end range)
│  └─ 10 Wall Angel (back against wall the entire rep)
│
└─ Movement prep:
   ├─ 15 🛒 Standard Push-Up (blood flow — easy pace)
   ├─ 10 🛒 Diamond Push-Up (Close-Grip) (elbows track back)
   └─ 10 🛒 Chest Dip (Lean Forward) (lean forward, feel the chest)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — CNS activation, rehearse each station movement before the circuit clock starts

⛽🏛🛒🟠▶️ (Primer | Chest/Front Delts/Triceps | Basics | Tier 1–2)

Rest: 60 sec between stations

Rehearse each station once at reduced load/effort before the full loop:

├─ Station preview — Weighted Chest Dip:
│  └─ 4 reps (lean, feel the chest, confirm the load is appropriate)
├─ Station preview — Dumbbell Overhead Press (Standing):
│  └─ 4 reps (full lockout, confirm dumbbell weight)
├─ Station preview — Diamond Push-Up (Close-Grip):
│  └─ 5 reps (elbows back, feel the tricep)
├─ Station preview — Dumbbell Bench Press:
│  └─ 4 reps (confirm dumbbell weight, groove the press)
└─ Station preview — Dumbbell Lateral Raise:
   └─ 8 reps (light — this is the recovery station, it should feel easy)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🎱 ARAM

🤌 facio — the circuit loop, tissue rotation, strength density

⛽🏛🛒🟠🎱 (ARAM | Chest/Front Delts/Triceps | Basics | Tier 0–3)

**Loop structure:**

The loop rotates: Chest-dominant → Tricep-dominant → Delt-dominant → Chest (repeat).
Each station recovers the tissue from the previous. No two adjacent stations target the same primary muscle.

```

**Station-by-station prescriptions:**

Rest between stations: 45–60 sec (enough to rotate and set up, not enough to fully recover)
Rest between rounds: 3 min (full recovery between loops — ⛽ Order demands this)

---

**Station A — Weighted Chest Dip (Chest, Sternal Head)**

├─ Tier 2 (weight vest or dipping belt with plate)
├─ Round 1: ⛽ working weight × 5 (lean forward 20–30°, elbows wide, drive through the chest)
├─ Round 2: ⛽ same × 5 (same position — if the lean disappears, the chest drops out)
└─ Round 3: ⛽ same × 4 (match quality — station is done when reps clean up)

Move to Station B immediately after each set.

---

**Station B — Diamond Push-Up (Close-Grip) (Triceps)**

├─ Tier 0 (bodyweight)
├─ Round 1: 6 reps (hands form a diamond, elbows track straight back — not flared)
├─ Round 2: 6 reps (pause 1 sec at the bottom — remove the bounce)
└─ Round 3: 5 reps (if 6 broke form, 5 clean beats 6 sloppy)

Move to Station C immediately after each set.

---

**Station C — Dumbbell Lateral Raise (Lateral Deltoid)**

├─ Tier 2 (light dumbbells — this is the tissue recovery station, not the strength station)
├─ Round 1: 10 reps (arms stay nearly straight, raise to shoulder height only)
├─ Round 2: 10 reps (control the descent — 2 sec down)
└─ Round 3: 8 reps (same — the shoulder is recovering the chest from Station A here)

Move to Station D immediately after each set.

---

**Station D — Dumbbell Bench Press (Chest, varied angle)**

├─ Tier 2 (moderate dumbbells — ⛽ load range, manageable without a spotter)
├─ Round 1: ⛽ working × 5 (arch, feet flat, press in arc, meet at the top)
├─ Round 2: ⛽ same × 5 (same groove — the dumbbell path is more individual than the bar)
└─ Round 3: ⛽ same × 4 (match — add nothing today)

Move to Station E immediately after each set.

---

**Station E — Close-Grip Dumbbell Press (Triceps, compound)**

├─ Tier 2 (moderate dumbbells, lighter than Station D)
├─ Round 1: 5 reps (dumbbells touching at the top and bottom, elbows track back)
├─ Round 2: 5 reps (same — feel the triceps at the top, not the chest)
└─ Round 3: 5 reps (steady — no bouncing off the chest)

Move to Station F immediately after each set.

---

**Station F — Dumbbell Overhead Press (Standing) (Front Delt, vertical)**

├─ Tier 2 (working weight dumbbells for strict OHP)
├─ Round 1: ⛽ working × 5 (brace before the press, full lockout, ribs down)
├─ Round 2: ⛽ same × 5 (head through at the top — ear forward)
└─ Round 3: ⛽ same × 4 (if the last rep broke, stop at 4)

Return to Station A after Station F. Rest 3 min, then repeat.

---

**Total rounds: 3**

## 4. 🪫 RELEASE

⛽🏛🛒🟠🪫 (Release | Chest/Shoulders/Triceps | Basics | Tier 0)

Circuit work accumulates tension across the whole shoulder girdle. Address it.

├─ Doorway Chest Stretch — 60 sec each side (full arm width in the doorway)
├─ Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch — 45 sec each side
├─ Child's Pose (Shoulder Stretch) — 60 sec (arms forward, thoracic drops)
└─ Band Pull-Apart — 2 × 12 (light, slow — rear delts open after all that pressing)

## 🧮 SAVE

The loop is not a workout shortcut. It is a deliberate tissue-rotation tool. The session only works if each station actually changes what is working. If two adjacent stations felt like the same muscle, the loop broke — note it and adjust before the next run.
