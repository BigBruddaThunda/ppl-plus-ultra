# 🛒 Push Circuit — Rotational Strength Loop 🛒

Station-based push strength | Chest, front delts, triceps | 50–60 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🛒🟠

> "Each station recovers what the last one worked. The loop is the logic."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — prepare all push tissue

- 10 Shoulder Dislocations
- 15 Band Pull-Apart
- 15 🛒 Standard Push-Up
- Preview each station once at 50% effort before the loop starts

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🎱 ARAM

🤌 facio — tissue rotation loop, 3 rounds

Loop logic: each station changes what tissue is working. No two adjacent stations hit the same primary muscle.

Rest between stations: 45–60 sec (rotate and set up, don't fully recover)
Rest between rounds: 3 min (⛽ Order demands full round recovery)

```
Station A — Chest          Station B — Triceps
Weighted Chest Dip         Diamond Push-Up
× 5 reps                   × 6 reps
(lean forward, chest)      (elbows back)

Station C — Delts          Station D — Chest (angle)
Dumbbell Lateral Raise     Dumbbell Bench Press
× 10 reps                  × 5 reps
(light, recovery)          (arch, full ROM)

Station E — Triceps        Station F — Delts (vertical)
Close-Grip DB Press        Dumbbell OHP (Standing)
× 5 reps                   × 5 reps
(inside grip)              (strict, full lock)

→ return to Station A for next round
```

**Load guideline for strength stations (A, D, E, F):**
Dumbbells at ⛽ working load — challenging 5s, not easy 5s.

**Station C** is the recovery station — light dumbbells, actively recovering the chest between station clusters.

Run 3 complete rounds.

## 3. 🪫 RELEASE

Circuit work accumulates tension across the whole shoulder girdle.

- Doorway Chest Stretch: 60 sec each side
- Child's Pose (arms extended): 60 sec
- Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch: 45 sec each side

## 🧮 SAVE

The loop only works if each station actually changes what's working. If two adjacent stations felt like the same muscle, the logic broke. Note it and adjust before the next run.
