# 🛒 Max Effort Push — Intense Barbell Day 🛒

**High-volume barbell strength | Chest, front delts, triceps | 80–90 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛🛒🔴

> "Every set goes somewhere. This session has nowhere to hide."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — activate everything before the load arrives

⛽🏛🛒🔴♨️ (Warm-Up | Chest/Shoulders/Triceps | Basics | Tier 2–4)

Rest: Move continuously.

├─ Shoulder activation:
│  ├─ 15 Band Pull-Apart (Overhead) (arms locked — retract hard)
│  ├─ 12 Scapular Push-Up (serratus loaded — no bend at the elbow)
│  └─ 10 Shoulder Dislocations (Band/PVC) (full arc, thoracic open)
│
└─ Bar warmup — Bench Press ramp:
   ├─ 15 🛒 Barbell Bench Press (empty bar — feel the path)
   ├─ Set 1: 50% × 6 (controlled, groove is everything)
   └─ Set 2: 60% × 5 (same groove — this is your last slow set)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — build intensity, signal max effort intent

⛽🏛🛒🔴▶️ (Primer | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–4)

Rest: 90 sec between sets

├─ Bench Press ramp:
│  ├─ Set 1: 65% × 4 (controlled, deliberate, build the intent)
│  ├─ Set 2: 72% × 3 (sharpening — this weight should feel light)
│  └─ Set 3: 78% × 2 (activation set — feel the max effort warmth)
│
└─ Push Jerk (Barbell) — explosive push activation (GOLD, 🔴 unlocks):
   ├─ Set 1: 50% × 3 (dip is small, drive is explosive, catch is solid)
   └─ Set 2: 55% × 3 (same — this is a CNS signal, not a strength test)

**Note on Push Jerk:** GOLD-gated. Only in 🔴 and 🟣 contexts. Use it here as a CNS activator before the heavy pressing. Keep load conservative in the primer — it is not the main event.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — primary strength work, maximum effort sets, high volume

⛽🏛🛒🔴🧈 (Bread & Butter | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–4)

Rest: 3 min between sets (reduced from standard — this is 🔴, push the density)

**A. Barbell Bench Press — main movement, high volume**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 78% × 5 (this is a working set, not a warmup)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 5 (same weight — repeat the quality)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 82% × 4 (push the ceiling — no grinding, but no held-back reps)
├─ Set 4: ⛽ 82% × 4 (match set 3)
└─ Set 5: ⛽ 80% × 5 (back-off set — volume at working weight)

Rest: 3 min between sets

**B. Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) — vertical press, volume**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 (strict, brace, drive)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5 (same — head through, full lockout)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4 (push the ceiling — keep it strict)
└─ Set 4: ⛽ 78% × 5 (back-off — volume matters today)

**Note:** 5 bench sets + 4 OHP sets is the high-volume signature of 🔴 in this code. The ⛽ Order ceiling still governs load. Volume goes up, not load.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — accessory volume, supersets permitted in 🔴

⛽🏛🛒🔴🧩 (Supplemental | Triceps/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–4)

Rest: 90 sec between supersets (reduced — 🔴 density protocol)

**Superset A — Chest + Tricep (paired, non-competing)**

Alternate between A1 and A2 with 90 sec rest after each A2.

├─ A1: Close-Grip Bench Press — ⛽ 70% × 5
│     (elbows track back, lockout is the rep)
└─ A2: Lying Barbell Tricep Extension (Skull Crusher) — moderate × 8
       (lower to the forehead, elbows stay up — do not swing)

Run 3 rounds.

Rest: 90 sec between rounds

**Superset B — Delt isolation pair**

Alternate B1 and B2 with 60 sec rest after each B2.

├─ B1: Incline Barbell Bench Press (30°) — ⛽ 68% × 5
│     (lower to upper chest, elbows at 45°, arch held)
└─ B2: Overhead Barbell Tricep Extension — moderate × 6
       (elbows point at ceiling, lower behind the head, full extension)

Run 2 rounds.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🌋 GUTTER

🤌 facio — max effort finisher, all-out push, one shot

⛽🏛🛒🔴🌋 (Gutter | Chest/Triceps | Basics | Tier 2–4)

Rest: Full 4 min before the Gutter. You will need it.

**Bench Press — AMRAP at 75%**

This is a single set of as many quality reps as possible at 75% of your 1RM. Stop the set the moment form breaks. Count only reps that meet the standard.

└─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × AMRAP (every rep bar to chest, full lockout — stop when form goes)

Log the rep count. That number is your density baseline for this weight.

**Gutter rules:** One set. No second attempt. If you did not earn 8+ reps, the bench is undertrained at this load or the volume before the Gutter was too high. Both are information.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE

⛽🏛🛒🔴🪫 (Release | Chest/Shoulders/Triceps | Basics | Tier 0–1)

🔴 context — stress OUT, not tension down. Discharge the effort.

├─ Foam Roll Pecs — 2 min total, slow passes (press into the tight spots)
├─ Foam Roll Lats — 90 sec each side
├─ PNF Chest Stretch (Contract-Relax) — 2 × 30 sec each side (exhale into the stretch)
├─ Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch — 45 sec each side
└─ Arm circles backward × 20 (full range, decompression)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 🧮 SAVE

The Gutter number is real data. More reps at 75% means the 80–82% sets are getting easier. That is when you raise the floor, not the ceiling.
