# 🛒 Coached Press — Teaching the Bench 🛒

Coached barbell pressing | Chest, front delts, triceps | 65–75 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🛒⚫

> "Put the bar in the right position before you try to move it heavy."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — arrive and set each contact point before loading

- 5 min easy movement — arm circles, chest openers
- 10 Shoulder Dislocations (band or PVC)
- 10 Wall Angel (slow, arms pressed back the whole rep)
- 15 🛒 Barbell Bench Press (empty bar — feel every contact point)
- 10 🛒 Barbell Overhead Press (empty bar — brace first, then press)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🛠 CRAFT

📍 pono — position before load. Take all the time this requires.

**Five contact points for bench press** (55–65% load, 3 slow sets × 5 reps):

1. Head flat on bench, eyes under the bar
2. Upper back tight — scapulae retracted and depressed before unracking
3. Glutes in contact with bench throughout
4. Feet flat on the floor, driving into it
5. Hands even, wrists neutral

After each set: name which contact point felt weakest. Correct it.

Also run 2 OHP sets (55%, 5 reps each):
- Brace before the bar moves — not during
- Head through the window at the top — ears forward

Rest: unlimited between 🛠 sets.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — apply what the craft work revealed

Rest: 4 min between all sets.

**A. 🛒 Barbell Bench Press**

- Set 1: 72% × 5 — say each contact point before unracking
- Set 2: 75% × 5 — pause 1 sec at the bottom. Loaded position check.
- Set 3: 78% × 4 — earn this weight only if sets 1–2 felt correct
- Set 4: 75% × 5 — back off to consolidate

**B. 🛒 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)**

- Set 1: 70% × 5 — full brace, no layback
- Set 2: 73% × 5 — head through at the top
- Set 3: 75% × 4 — where does it break down?

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — lockout work at teaching quality

Rest: 3 min

**🛒 Close-Grip Bench Press**

- Set 1: 65% × 5 (elbows track back and in — tricep emphasis, squeeze at top)
- Set 2: 67% × 5 (same)
- Set 3: 67% × 5 (same)

## 🧮 SAVE

The bench press is deceptively simple. The five contact points are the whole game. One session at ⚫ Teaching quality is worth three sessions of loading without awareness.
