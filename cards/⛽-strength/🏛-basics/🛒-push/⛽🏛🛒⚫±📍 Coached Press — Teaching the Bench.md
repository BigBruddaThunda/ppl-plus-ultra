# 🛒 Coached Press — Teaching the Bench 🛒

**Barbell strength instruction | Chest, front delts, triceps | 75–85 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛🛒⚫

> "Put the bar in the right position before you try to move it heavy."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — establish the setup before anything loads

⛽🏛🛒⚫♨️ (Warm-Up | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Rest: Move at your own pace. No clock.

├─ 5 min general movement — arm circles, chest openers, wall slides
│
├─ Shoulder prep:
│  ├─ 10 🛒 Shoulder Dislocations (Band/PVC) (slow, full arc both ways)
│  ├─ 10 🛒 Band Pull-Apart (Overhead) (retract at the top)
│  └─ 10 🛒 Scapular Push-Up (feel the shoulder blade move)
│
└─ Bar warmup (empty bar only):
   ├─ 15 🛒 Barbell Bench Press (empty bar — feel the groove)
   └─ 10 🛒 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) (empty bar — set the shoulder position)

**Coaching note:** Before moving to primer, confirm: arch is neutral, feet are flat, scapulae are retracted and depressed. These positions lock in now, before load.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — CNS activation, position rehearsal at moderate load

⛽🏛🛒⚫▶️ (Primer | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 90 sec between ramp sets

├─ Ramp sets — Barbell Bench Press:
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 45% × 8 (elbows at 45°, bar to sternum, controlled)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ 55% × 6 (same groove — do not rush the descent)
│  └─ Set 3: ⛽ 65% × 4 (this is your last warmup, treat the groove seriously)
│
└─ Ramp sets — Barbell Overhead Press (Standing):
   ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 45% × 6 (press straight up, head through at the top)
   └─ Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 4 (lock out, stack the shoulder over the hip)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🛠 CRAFT

📍 pono — skill acquisition, technique coaching before heavy work begins

⛽🏛🛒⚫🛠 (Craft | Chest/Front Delts/Triceps | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 3–4 min between sets. Take every second you need.

**Teaching focus: Barbell Bench Press mechanics**

├─ Touch points before each set:
│  ├─ Grip width: index finger on the ring marks, thumbs around the bar
│  ├─ Scapular position: pull them together and down before unracking
│  ├─ Foot position: flat, planted, drive through the floor
│  └─ Bar path: slight diagonal — touch low sternum, press back toward the rack
│
├─ Paused Bench Press (2-second chest pause):
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 4 (pause dead still on the chest — no bounce, no slack)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ 70% × 4 (same load — feel the difference between tension and rest)
│  └─ Set 3: ⛽ 72% × 4 (add 2% only if the pause was honest both sets)
│
└─ Teaching set — Spoto Press (Paused Above Chest):
   ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 4 (stop 1–2 inches off the chest — see where the bar drifts)
   └─ Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 4 (correct the drift before completing the rep)

**Coaching note:** The Spoto Press reveals bar path. If the bar drifts toward your face, your elbows are too flared. If it drifts toward your belly, they are too tucked. Find the middle.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — primary strength work, extended rest, quality over speed

⛽🏛🛒⚫🧈 (Bread & Butter | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 4 min between all sets. Do not shorten this.

**A. Barbell Bench Press — working sets**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 78% × 5 (the groove is already in your hands — use it)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 5 (tighten the upper back before unracking)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 82% × 4 (if the groove holds, this is clean — if not, drop 2%)
└─ Set 4: ⛽ 80% × 5 (back off to consolidate — same cues, same bar path)

Rest: 4 min

**B. Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) — working sets**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 (brace before you press, not during)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5 (head through the window at the top — ear forward, not down)
└─ Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4 (if you lost position on the first two, stay at 78%)

**Coaching note:** These are heavy sets. The goal today is not a PR. The goal is to move the same weight better than you did last session.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — secondary push work supporting the main lifts

⛽🏛🛒⚫🧩 (Supplemental | Triceps/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 3 min between sets

**A. Close-Grip Bench Press — tricep lockout**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 5 (hands inside shoulder width, elbows brush the body)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 72% × 5 (think about the top — squeeze the lockout)
└─ Set 3: ⛽ 72% × 5 (same load — any pressing issue shows up here)

Rest: 3 min

**B. Dumbbell Overhead Press (Seated)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ moderate × 6 (elbows at 90° at the bottom, full lock at top)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ moderate × 6 (press in a slight arc, not straight up)
└─ Set 3: ⛽ moderate × 5 (if the last rep broke position, stop at 5 next time)

**Coaching note:** The Close-Grip Bench fixes weak lockout. If your bench press stalls in the top third, this is the work that pays for it.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE

⛽🏛🛒⚫🪫 (Release | Chest/Shoulders | Basics | Tier 0–1)

Parasympathetic reset. Slow down.

├─ Doorway Chest Stretch — 60 sec each side (find the stretch, breathe into it)
├─ Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch — 45 sec each side (no forcing)
├─ Band Pull-Apart — 2 × 15 (light band, slow, feel the rear delts open)
└─ Foam Roll Pecs — 90 sec each side (pause on tight spots)

═══════════════════════════════════════

**Next sessions:**
- Next → ⛽🏛🛒🔵 — run the same movements with full prescribed load, no coaching pauses
- Next → ⛽🏛🪡⚫ — pair with pull-side teaching: barbell row and weighted pull-up
- Next → 🦋🏛🛒🔵 — drop to hypertrophy load once the bar path is reliable

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 🧮 SAVE

The teaching session is not slower than a regular session — it is more deliberate. The bar path you ingrain today under moderate load is the one that holds when load climbs. Log the notes, not just the numbers.
