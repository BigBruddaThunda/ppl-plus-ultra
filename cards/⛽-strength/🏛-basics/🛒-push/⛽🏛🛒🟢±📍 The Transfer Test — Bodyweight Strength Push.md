# 🛒 The Transfer Test — Bodyweight Strength Push 🛒

**Advanced calisthenics | Chest, front delts, triceps | 65–75 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛🛒🟢

> "Find out if your gym strength lives in your body or just in the bar."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — position the body before any load, no equipment needed

⛽🏛🛒🟢♨️ (Warm-Up | Chest/Shoulders/Triceps | Basics | Tier 0)

Rest: Move continuously. No clock.

├─ Joint prep:
│  ├─ 10 Arm Circles (Forward) + 10 Arm Circles (Backward) (full range, no short-cutting)
│  ├─ 10 Shoulder Dislocations (Band/PVC) or use a towel (slow, feel the thoracic open)
│  └─ 10 Scapular Push-Up (feel the serratus, no arm bend)
│
├─ Movement warmup:
│  ├─ 15 🛒 Standard Push-Up (easy pace — this is just blood flow)
│  ├─ 10 🛒 Wide-Grip Push-Up (find the chest stretch at the bottom)
│  └─ 10 🛒 Diamond Push-Up (Close-Grip) (elbows track back, not out)
│
└─ Handstand prep (if applicable):
   ├─ 30 sec Handstand Hold (Wall) (lock the core, ribs down)
   └─ 5 🛒 Pike Push-Up (press through the hands, not just the shoulders)

**Note:** If HSPU progressions are in today's session, the handstand hold is mandatory prep.

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — CNS potentiation, establish bodyweight-to-strength intent

⛽🏛🛒🟢▶️ (Primer | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 0–2)

Rest: 2 min between sets

├─ A. Weighted Push-Up (Vest) — ramp sets:
│  ├─ Set 1: bodyweight × 8 (dial in wrist, elbow, shoulder stack)
│  ├─ Set 2: light vest × 6 (add load, keep same position)
│  └─ Set 3: working vest × 4 (this is your CNS signal — controlled, deliberate)
│
└─ B. Chest Dip (Lean Forward) — ramp sets:
   ├─ Set 1: bodyweight × 6 (lean forward, feel the chest not the tricep)
   └─ Set 2: bodyweight × 4 (slow eccentric — 3 sec down)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — primary strength work, bodyweight-loaded to ⛽ ceiling

⛽🏛🛒🟢🧈 (Bread & Butter | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 0–2)

Rest: 3–4 min between all sets.

**A. Weighted Chest Dip — primary horizontal press replacement**

The chest dip at strength loads is the barbell bench equivalent in this lane.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ working weight × 5 (lean forward 20–30°, elbows wide, chest drives down)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ working weight × 5 (same lean — do not let elbows drift in)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ add 2–5% × 4 (stay honest — if the lean disappeared, back off)
└─ Set 4: ⛽ working weight × 5 (back to working weight — lock in the positions)

Rest: 4 min

**B. Handstand Push-Up (Wall) or Wall Handstand Push-Up — vertical press**

If full HSPU is not available, use Pike Push-Up with feet elevated on a chair.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 5 reps (head touches, full lock at top — no partial reps)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 4 reps (if rep 4 breaks position, stop at 3 — no grinding)
└─ Set 3: ⛽ 4–5 reps (match set 2, same quality or better)

Rest: 4 min

**C. Archer Push-Up — bilateral strength through unilateral loading**

This is the bodyweight version of a heavy dumbbell press. One arm loads, one assists.

├─ Set 1: 5 each side (straight arm tracks wide, bent arm drives down)
├─ Set 2: 5 each side (same — keep the hips level, no rotation)
└─ Set 3: 4 each side (slow the descent to 3 sec — add difficulty through tempo, not instability)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — secondary pressing patterns, non-redundant angles

⛽🏛🛒🟢🧩 (Supplemental | Triceps/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 0–2)

Rest: 3 min between sets

**A. Ring Push-Up or TRX Push-Up — instability challenges stability**

├─ Set 1: 5 reps (rings turned out at the top — think "bend the rings apart")
├─ Set 2: 5 reps (same cue — if you cannot hold the turnout, the rings are too low)
└─ Set 3: 4–5 reps (match quality, not count)

Rest: 3 min

**B. Deficit Push-Up — full chest stretch at the bottom**

Use two plates, two books, or two push-up handles. Tier 1–2 equipment.

├─ Set 1: 5 reps (chest drops below hand level — controlled, not a flop)
├─ Set 2: 5 reps (pause 1 sec at the bottom — no bounce)
└─ Set 3: 4 reps (add a 2-sec pause if 5 was easy with no bounce)

Rest: 3 min

**C. Weighted Push-Up (Plate on Back) — tricep finisher**

├─ Set 1: 6 reps with moderate plate (elbows track back, not flared)
└─ Set 2: 6 reps (squeeze the triceps at lockout — full extension)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

⛽🏛🛒🟢🪫 (Release | Chest/Shoulders | Basics | Tier 0)

Tension down. No equipment needed.

├─ Doorway Chest Stretch — 60 sec each side (or corner stretch on a wall)
├─ Child's Pose (Shoulder Stretch) — 60 sec (arms extended, thoracic drops toward floor)
├─ Cross-Body Shoulder Stretch — 45 sec each side
└─ Shoulder CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations) — 5 each direction, each shoulder

## 🧮 SAVE

This session answers one question: does the strength you built under the bar exist in your body when the bar is gone. Log what translated and what exposed a gap. The gap is the next program.
