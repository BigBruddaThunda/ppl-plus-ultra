# 🛒 Press Variety — Exploration Push Day 🛒

Varied implements and angles | Chest, front delts, triceps | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🛒🟡

> "Same constraints. Different implement. What does the pattern feel like from here?"

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — set the shoulder position before exploring new tools

- 10 Shoulder Dislocations
- 15 Band Pull-Apart
- 15 🛒 Standard Push-Up
- 2 ramp sets of whatever press you're opening with (50% × 5, 65% × 3)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — barbell anchor, standard parameters

Even in 🟡, the barbell bench is the main event. Explore from here.

Rest: 3–4 min

**🛒 Barbell Bench Press**

- Set 1: 78% × 5
- Set 2: 80% × 5
- Set 3: 82% × 4

Bar to lower sternum. Elbows 45°.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🏖 SANDBOX

📍 pono — structured exploration, one implement or angle

⛽ ceiling applies throughout: 75–85%, 4–6 reps, 3 min rest. The constraint is fixed. The implement is open.

Pick one you haven't done in a while. Run 3 sets.

**Options:**

A — Incline Barbell Bench Press (30°)
Upper chest and front delt emphasis. Does the groove feel different?

B — Swiss Bar Bench Press
Neutral grip reduces shoulder rotation. What does the chest feel doing less rotation?

C — Larsen Press (feet up)
No leg drive. Pure upper body pressing. Heavier than it feels.

D — Barbell Military Press (seated, strict)
No hip shift at all. Where does your OHP break down?

E — Dumbbell Bench Press at working weight
Each arm works independently. Which side drives harder?

F — Decline Barbell Bench Press
Lower chest emphasis. Wider elbows. Compare the lockout to flat bench.

**Sandbox sets (3 sets of the chosen option):**
- Set 1: 75% × 5 — get the feel
- Set 2: 78% × 4 — work it
- Set 3: 78% × 4 — one more

Note what felt different. That's the data from this session.

## 🧮 SAVE

🟡 Fun is not unfocused. The constraint is still in effect. What changes is the implement. Write down what you found — the next structured session should be smarter for it.
