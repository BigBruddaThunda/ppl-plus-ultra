# 🛒 Heavy Slow Press — Mindful Barbell Push 🛒

**4-second eccentric barbell strength | Chest, front delts, triceps | 80–90 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛🛒⚪

> "The weight descends on your terms, not on its own. Four seconds down, every rep."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — set every contact point before the bar is loaded

⛽🏛🛒⚪♨️ (Warm-Up | Chest/Shoulders/Triceps | Basics | Tier 0–2)

Rest: Move slowly. No rush.

├─ Breathing and arrival:
│  ├─ 5 deep breaths — in through the nose, out through the mouth (reset the nervous system)
│  └─ 3 min light movement — shoulder circles, arm swings, thoracic rotation
│
├─ Shoulder mobility:
│  ├─ 10 Shoulder Dislocations (Band/PVC) (4 sec per rep — feel every degree of the arc)
│  ├─ 10 Wall Angel (slow — 4 sec up, 4 sec down — this is the mindful warm-up)
│  └─ 10 Scapular Push-Up (feel the serratus activate, no arm bend)
│
└─ Bar warmup — slow tempo only:
   ├─ 12 🛒 Barbell Bench Press (empty bar — 4 sec down, 1 sec pause, 2 sec up)
   └─ 10 🛒 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) (empty bar — 3 sec down, 2 sec up, full lockout)

**Breathing cue for the session:** Inhale during the eccentric (the descent). Exhale at the midpoint or on the press. Every set, every rep.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — CNS activation under tempo constraint — ramp without rushing

⛽🏛🛒⚪▶️ (Primer | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 2 min between sets (already mindful rest begins here)

Tempo applies to all ramp sets: 4 sec eccentric throughout.

├─ Bench Press ramp:
│  ├─ Set 1: 50% × 5 (4 sec down — feel every inch of the bar path, pause 1 sec on chest)
│  ├─ Set 2: 60% × 4 (same tempo — the 4-second descent should feel natural before the load climbs)
│  └─ Set 3: 68% × 3 (near working weight — same 4 sec, same breathing, same pause)
│
└─ OHP ramp:
   ├─ Set 1: 50% × 4 (3 sec down — feel the shoulder load, full lockout at top)
   └─ Set 2: 63% × 3 (same — do not rush the descent, the strength is in the eccentric)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — primary strength work, 4-second eccentrics, extended rest, no supersets

⛽🏛🛒⚪🧈 (Bread & Butter | Chest/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–3)

**Tempo prescription for all sets: 4-1-2-0**
- 4 seconds eccentric (lowering)
- 1 second pause at the bottom
- 2 seconds concentric (pressing)
- 0 pause at the top (return immediately)

Rest: 3 min between sets (extended — ⚪ color prescription)

**A. Barbell Bench Press — heavy slow bench**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 78% × 4 (inhale → 4 sec down → 1 sec pause on chest → exhale → press)
│         (elbows at 45°, bar to low sternum — feel the pec loaded in the stretch)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 4 (same tempo — if the eccentric collapsed on set 1, stay at 78%)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4 (match set 2 — the 4-second eccentric at 80% is the work)
└─ Set 4: ⛽ 78% × 4 (back-off set — maintain tempo, do not shortcut the descent)

Rest: 3 min between sets

**B. Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) — heavy slow OHP**

Tempo: 3-1-2-0 (OHP gets 3 sec descent, same pause, 2 sec press)

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 4 (inhale → 3 sec down → pause → exhale → press through — head through the window)
│         (ribs down throughout, no layback — the slow descent makes cheating obvious)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 4 (same — feel where the shoulders load in the descent)
└─ Set 3: ⛽ 78% × 4 (match set 2 — if the tempo held, that is the win)

**Note on slow eccentrics and load:** 78–80% at 4-sec eccentric is substantially harder than the same load at standard tempo. These rep counts are intentionally reduced to 4 to keep the quality honest under the extended time-under-tension. The ⛽ Order ceiling governs load, not the difficulty of the tempo.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — accessory work, tempo maintained, no supersets

⛽🏛🛒⚪🧩 (Supplemental | Triceps/Front Delts | Basics | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 3 min between sets (no reducing rest in this color)

**A. Slow Eccentric Bench Press (5-second lower)**

One step slower than the main sets. This is pure time-under-tension work for the chest.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 68% × 4 (5 sec down — this is longer than 4 sec, feel the difference)
│         (pause 2 sec at the bottom — no bounce, no rushing — exhale and press)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 68% × 4 (same — match the tempo, not the load)

Rest: 3 min

**B. Close-Grip Bench Press — slow eccentric, tricep focus**

Tempo: 4-1-2-0 (same as main bench tempo)

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 4 (4 sec down with close grip — elbows hug the body, feel the tricep stretch)
│         (inhale on the way down, exhale and press)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 67% × 4 (same — lockout at top, full press)

Rest: 3 min

**C. Dumbbell Overhead Press (Seated) — controlled slow press**

Tempo: 3-1-2-0

├─ Set 1: moderate × 5 (3 sec down — elbows at 90° at bottom, full lock at top)
│         (feel the shoulder load in the bottom stretch — breathe into it)
└─ Set 2: moderate × 5 (same — no rushing the descent on rep 4 or 5)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

⛽🏛🛒⚪🪫 (Release | Chest/Shoulders/Triceps | Basics | Tier 0–1)

⚪ context — parasympathetic downregulation. Tension DOWN. Breathe through it.

├─ Seated breathing — 2 min (in for 4 counts, hold for 4, out for 8 — box breathing variation)
├─ Doorway Chest Stretch — 90 sec each side (hold the stretch, breathe into the chest, do not force it deeper)
├─ Child's Pose (Shoulder Stretch) — 90 sec (arms extended, thoracic drops toward floor — breathe into the upper back)
├─ Floor Pec Stretch (Lying) — 60 sec each side (arm out at 90°, rotate until the chest opens — slow breathing)
└─ Shoulder CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations) — 5 circles each direction, each shoulder (slow and controlled)

**Closing cue:** Do not rush out of this session. The release block is half the session in ⚪ color. The nervous system leaves quieter than it arrived.

**Next sessions:**
- Next → ⛽🏛🛒🔵 — return to standard tempo; the slow eccentric work should make standard sets feel snappier
- Next → ⛽🏛🪡⚪ — paired mindful session on the pull side; slow eccentric rows and pull-ups
- Next → 🖼🏛🛒⚪ — full restoration press if CNS is high and a full deload is needed

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 🧮 SAVE

The 4-second eccentric at strength load is a different kind of hard. It is not a test of aggression — it is a test of control. The muscle that gets stronger under slow loading is the muscle that will hold position when the weight is heavy and fast. Log the tempo, not just the load.
