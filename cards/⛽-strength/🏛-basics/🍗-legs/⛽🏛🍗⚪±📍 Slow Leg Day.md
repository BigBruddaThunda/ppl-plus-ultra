# 🍗 Slow Leg Day 🍗

Mindful barbell strength | Quads, hamstrings, glutes | 75–85 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🍗⚪

> "Four seconds down — feel every degree of the movement before you earn the drive."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — extended warm-up in ⚪ context; the nervous system needs longer to settle

- 5 min easy walk or bike (let the breathing slow, not speed up)
- 10 Deep Squat Hold (ATG) (5 sec at the bottom, breathe into your hips)
- 10/side Hip CARs (slow, feel the end range)
- 5/side World's Greatest Stretch (hold each position 3 sec)
- 10 Glute Bridge (3-sec hold at top, breathe out)
- 5 Back Squat at empty bar (4-sec descent — feel every degree)

Rest: 60 sec between movements.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — slow ramp; the tempo is the training, not just the weight

Tempo: 4-0-1 (4 sec descent, no pause, 1 sec rise)

- Set 1: 55% × 4 (breathe in before descent, hold the brace for 4 full seconds)
- Set 2: 65% × 3 (count silently: one, two, three, four — no shortcuts)
- Set 3: 72% × 2 (at this load, 4 seconds is a serious discipline — honor it)

Rest: 2 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — this is not easy weight. This is slow weight.

Tempo: 4-0-1 on all working sets.
Rest: 3 min between sets. ⚪ context demands full recovery between slow efforts.

**🍗 Back Squat (High Bar) — 4-Sec Eccentric**

Breathing cue: inhale at the top, hold the brace through the full 4-sec descent, exhale on the drive.

- Set 1: 77% × 5 (4-sec descent — chest stays tall the whole way down)
- Set 2: 80% × 5 (the eccentric is the work — do not fall; lower deliberately)
- Set 3: 80% × 4 (feel where tension breaks — that is where your squat normally cheats)
- Set 4: 82% × 4 (4 seconds makes this harder than 90% without tempo — respect that)
- Set 5: 82% × 4 (last rep same tempo as first rep — no speeding up when tired)

**🍗 Romanian Deadlift — 4-Sec Eccentric**

- Set 1: 72% × 5 (4 sec to the bottom — feel the hamstring load the whole way)
- Set 2: 75% × 5 (breathe at the top between reps — do not rush the cycle)
- Set 3: 77% × 5 (lats pack down as you lower — no rounding at the bottom)
- Set 4: 77% × 4 (stand tall, exhale fully at lockout — reset before next rep)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — parasympathetic downregulation, tension DOWN

⚪ release: not just stretching — arriving in the body.

- 90 sec/side Couch Stretch (breathe into the hip crease)
- 90 sec/side Pigeon Pose (no forcing; let gravity do the work)
- 60 sec Butterfly Stretch (hands on feet, elbows on knees, breathe low)
- 60 sec Standing Calf Stretch
- 60 sec Deep Squat Hold (settle into the bottom — last thing you do here)
- 5 slow standing breaths (exhale fully before leaving)

No timer on the release. Stay until the breath has steadied.

## 🧮 SAVE

The 4-second eccentric doesn't build patience — it reveals position. Every centimeter of the descent under control is a centimeter you have actually earned. Take what you learned back into full-speed work.
