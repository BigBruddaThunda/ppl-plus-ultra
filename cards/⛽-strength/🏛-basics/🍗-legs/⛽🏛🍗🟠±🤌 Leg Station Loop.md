# 🍗 Leg Station Loop 🍗

Circuit strength, no barbells | Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves | 50–60 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🍗🟠

> "Rotate the tissue, keep the loop moving — every station recovers while another works."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — short and purposeful; circuits run on momentum

- 10 Air Squat (hips below parallel, knees track out)
- 10 Glute Bridge (posterior chain activation)
- 10/side Leg Swings (Forward/Back)
- 10/side Hip CARs
- 10/side Hip Flexor Stretch (Kneeling)

Preview each station once at 50% effort before the loop starts.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🎱 ARAM

🤌 facio — tissue rotation loop, 5 rounds

Loop logic: no two adjacent stations train the same tissue.

Rest between stations: 15 sec (rotate and set up)
Rest between rounds: 90 sec

```
Station A — Quads           Station B — Posterior Chain
Goblet Squat                Dumbbell RDL
× 5 reps                    × 5 reps
(chest up, hips below       (hips back, soft knees,
knees, elbows in)           bar drags the legs)

Station C — Glutes          Station D — Adductors
Dumbbell Hip Thrust         Weighted Lateral Lunge
× 5 reps                    × 3/side
(chin tucked, drive hips    (knee tracks toe,
up, 1 sec hold at top)      push back to center)

Station E — Calves
Single-Leg Calf Raise (Weighted)
× 5/side
(full stretch at bottom, pause at top)

→ return to Station A for next round
```

**Load guidance:** Dumbbells and kettlebells at the heavy end of what you can control for 5 controlled reps. No barbells.

Run 5 complete rounds.

## 3. 🪫 RELEASE

Five rounds of leg circuit leaves residual tension; address it.

- 45 sec/side Couch Stretch (Hip Flexor Deep)
- 45 sec Standing Hamstring Stretch
- 30 sec/side Pigeon Pose
- 45 sec Standing Calf Stretch
- 60 sec Deep Squat Hold (breathe and settle)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🚂 JUNCTION

```
Date: ___________
Station A (Goblet Squat): load ___ × 5 rounds
Station B (DB RDL): load ___ × 5 rounds
Station C (DB Hip Thrust): load ___ × 5 rounds
Loop logic held: Y/N
Station that fatigued first: ___________
```

- 🦋🏛🍗🟠 — same circuit format at hypertrophy order; longer sets, shorter rest
- ⛽🏛🪡🟠 — pull circuit to pair for a full-body circuit week

## 🧮 SAVE

The circuit doesn't replace the barbell — it reveals what the barbell hides. Which station broke down first tells you where the gap lives. Take that back into your structure.
