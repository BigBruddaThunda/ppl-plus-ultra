# 🍗 Leg Day Variations 🍗

Exploratory strength | Quads, hamstrings, glutes | 65–75 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🍗🟡

> "Same strength ceiling, different doors — find out which squat pattern works best for you."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — playful doesn't mean sloppy. Position first.

- 10 Air Squat (baseline feel before variations)
- 10 Deep Squat Hold (sink, breathe, explore the bottom)
- 10/side Hip CARs
- 5/side World's Greatest Stretch
- 10 Goblet Squat Pause (light KB, pause 2 sec at bottom — feel the angles)

Primer: sample each variation at 60–65% before choosing today's anchor.

- 3 Back Squat at 65% (classic feel)
- 3 Front Squat at 60% (more upright, quad-forward)
- 3 Zercher Squat at 60% (elbows in, uncomfortable in a good way)

Choose your anchor: ___________________________

Rest: 90 sec after primer.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — commit to the choice you made in the primer

Rest: 3–4 min between sets — strength ceiling still applies.

**🍗 Your Chosen Squat Variation**

- Set 1: 77% × 5 (lock in the new pattern)
- Set 2: 80% × 5 (how does this variation feel under load?)
- Set 3: 80% × 5 (if front squat: elbows up, not just high / if zercher: breathe against the bar)
- Set 4: 82% × 4 (hold the pattern as load increases)
- Set 5: 82% × 4 (log how this compared to your default squat)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🏖 SANDBOX

📍 pono — same strength range, new angles on hinge and lunge

Pick two options from the list. Run 3 sets each at 75–80%.

Rules: stay within ⛽ load ceiling (75–85%, 4–6 reps). Stay within 🍗 Legs muscles. No GOLD.

Options:
- 🍗 Barbell Good Morning (hinge, not bow — hips back, hamstrings are the target)
- 🍗 Barbell Walking Lunge (long stride, front shin vertical, stay tall through the torso)
- 🍗 Kang Squat (squat down, hinge forward on the way up — two patterns in one)
- 🍗 Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift (more feedback than the bar — feel each side)

For each chosen exercise:
- Set 1: 77% × 5
- Set 2: 80% × 4
- Set 3: 80% × 4

Rest: 2–3 min.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — anchor the glute work after the variation play

Rest: 3 min

**🍗 Barbell Hip Thrust**

- Set 1: 78% × 5 (chin tucked, ribs down, drive the hips — not the spine)
- Set 2: 80% × 5 (glutes are the engine, hamstrings are the guardrails)
- Set 3: 80% × 5
- Set 4: 82% × 4 (hard lockout, 1-sec hold at top)

## 🧮 SAVE

Variety inside a strength ceiling is not frivolous — it is reconnaissance. You are finding which patterns your body transfers well. That is training intelligence.
