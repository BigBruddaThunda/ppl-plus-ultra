# 🍗 The Squat Lesson 🍗

Coached barbell legs | Quads, glutes, hamstrings | 70–80 min

CODE: ⛽🏛🍗⚫

> "Learn the squat before you load the squat — today you do both."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — set the pattern before the bar touches your back

- 10 Deep Squat Hold (ATG) (sink, breathe, own the bottom)
- 10/side World's Greatest Stretch
- 10 Hip CARs (slow, feel the range)
- 10 Leg Swings (Forward/Back)
- 10 Air Squat (knees track toes, hips below parallel)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🛠 CRAFT

📍 pono — position is the product here. Load stays at 40–55%. Every rep gets a cue.

Rest: unlimited between teaching sets.

**Five setup points for the back squat:**

1. Bar position — high-bar on traps, not neck
2. Grip width — narrow enough to create upper back tension
3. Brace — 360-degree pressure before descent, not during
4. Descent — hips back and down, not just down
5. Drive — chest up out of the hole, not hips first

Run 3 teaching sets × 4 reps at 45–55%:
- Set 1: setup points 1–3 (bar position, grip, brace)
- Set 2: depth check — hips crease below top of knee
- Set 3: drive phase — knees out, chest leads

After each set: name which setup point broke. Correct it.

Also: 2 sets of Bent-Over Row (55%, 5 reps) — the hinge pattern that will carry into RDL later.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — apply the setup under working load

Rest: 4 min between all sets.

**🍗 Back Squat (High Bar)**

- Set 1: 77% × 5 (brace, hips back, chest up, drive floor)
- Set 2: 80% × 5 (same pattern — do not change what worked)
- Set 3: 80% × 5 (if depth breaks, the weight is too heavy)
- Set 4: 82% × 4 (stay over the bar, not behind it)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — posterior chain complement to the squat

Rest: 3 min

**🍗 Romanian Deadlift**

- Set 1: 75% × 5 (hinge at hip, not bend at waist — different thing)
- Set 2: 78% × 5 (bar drags the legs, not swings away)
- Set 3: 78% × 5 (feel the hamstring load before the bottom)

## 🧮 SAVE

The squat is not complicated — but it is unforgiving of shortcuts. Every cue absorbed today compounds over years of training. Log what clicked. Return to this card when load or technique breaks down.
