Mindful full-body power | 4-second eccentrics, breath-driven isometrics | 70–80 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➕⚪

> "The bar moves slowly. The attention moves with it."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — arrive completely. 12–15 minutes. No rushing.

- 5 breaths Box Breathing (Core Control) (4 sec in / 4 sec hold / 4 sec out / 4 sec hold — settle before anything else)
- 2 rounds:
  - 8 Cat-Cow (Core Mobility) (4 sec per direction — full range)
  - 8 Dead Bug (4 sec each rep — lower back sealed, breathe into the belly)
  - 8/side Bird Dog Hold (5 sec each — no hip rotation, no rib flare)
  - 60 sec Hollow Body Hold (brace before lifting, breathe short)
- 6 Front Squat (Core Bracing) at empty bar, 4 sec descent (feel every position on the way down)
- 6 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) at empty bar, 4 sec lowering (feel the bar in space at lockout)

**Breath cue for this session:** Inhale before the lift. Exhale slowly during the eccentric. The brace increases during the eccentric — do not let it drop with the exhale.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

📍 pono — inhabit the positions before loading them

Rest: 2 min between sets.

**➕ Overhead Barbell Hold — Position Awareness**

- Set 1: 30 sec (empty bar — shoulders active, arms locked, breathe)
- Set 2: 30 sec (add small plate — same position, more demand)
- Set 3: 30 sec (same load — feel the difference when you exhale)

Then:

- 3 sets × 3 reps Front Squat (Core Bracing) at 50% (4 sec descent, 2 sec pause in the hole, drive up)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — every rep is 4 seconds down. No exceptions.

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**A — ➕ Front Squat (Core Bracing) — 4-0-1 Tempo**

*(4 sec eccentric | 0 pause unless noted | 1 sec concentric)*

- Set 1: 75% × 4 (4 sec down — elbows high, feel the rack on the collarbone)
- Set 2: 75% × 4 (4 sec down — exhale is slow, brace holds)
- Set 3: 77% × 4 (4-2-1 — add 2 sec pause in the hole)
- Set 4: 79% × 4 (at this weight the tempo is demanding — honor it)
- Set 5: 80% × 4 (same attention as Set 1 — not less)

**B — ➕ Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) — 3-0-2 Tempo**

*(3 sec lowering | 0 pause | 2 sec press)*

- Set 1: 75% × 4 (3 sec lower — feel the bar through the full descent)
- Set 2: 76% × 4 (exhale on the 2-sec press — controlled)
- Set 3: 77% × 4 (lats set before the press starts — not after)
- Set 4: 78% × 4 (final set — full lockout, bar directly overhead)

Rest: 3 min between all sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — isometric core. Hold the position. Breathe into it.

Rest: 2–3 min

**➕ Pallof Hold (Isometric)**

Not the press. The hold. Arms fully extended throughout.

- Set 1: 30 sec/side (arms out — hold there, breathe in through nose)
- Set 2: 30 sec/side (same position — exhale fully without the trunk rotating)
- Set 3: 30 sec/side (notice which side is harder — that is information)
- Set 4: 30 sec/side (exhale slowly, maintain position until time stops)

**➕ Dead Bug — Slow (5 sec per rep)**

Each rep is a breath cycle.

- Set 1: 6 reps (5 sec to lower arm and opposite leg — lower back must not lift)
- Set 2: 6 reps (inhale as you extend, exhale as you return)
- Set 3: 6 reps (if lower back lifts, reduce range before adding breath control)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

📍 pono — parasympathetic downregulation. Tension down. 10–15 minutes.

- 3 min Diaphragmatic Breathing (hands on belly — feel it rise on inhale, exhale is 2× the inhale)
- 90 sec Child's Pose (Core Release) (arms extended overhead — breathe into lower back)
- 60 sec/side Supine Spinal Twist (passive — let the weight of the leg do the work)
- 60 sec/side Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch (front squats compressed these)
- 5 breaths 90/90 Breathing (knees bent, feet flat — last breath practice before leaving)

No timer on the release. Stay until the breath has steadied.

## 🧮 SAVE

A 75% front squat with a 4-second eccentric is not a deload. It is the same weight with twice the time under tension and full breath accountability. The work did not become easier — the attention became sharper.
