CODE: ⛽🏛➕🔵

> "Log every set. The ledger is how this gets better."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — prepare the CNS for the pull pattern and overhead demand

- 10 Dead Bug (lower back sealed — anterior chain online before loading)
- 8 Hollow Body Rock (brace before you move)
- 8 High Pull (Barbell) at empty bar (hip drive to shrug — feel the sequence)
- 6 Front Squat (Core Bracing) at empty bar (elbows forward, depth below parallel)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — activate the power pull pattern before working load

Rest: 2 min between sets.

**➕ High Pull (Barbell)**

- Set 1: 55% × 4 (deliberate — feel the hip-to-shrug sequence, not arm-first)
- Set 2: 65% × 3 (add speed — hips extend first, elbows follow)
- Set 3: 72% × 2 (approach feel — this is what the working weight will require)

Rest: 3 min before 🧈.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — execute. Log every number.

Rest: 3 min between all sets.

**A. ➕ Front Squat (Core Bracing)**

- Set 1: 77% × 5 (elbows high, brace 360° before descent)
- Set 2: 80% × 5 (knees track toes — do not let them drift in)
- Set 3: 80% × 5 (chest leads out of the hole — hips follow the chest)
- Set 4: 82% × 4 (same pattern, more load — if elbows drop, the weight is too heavy)
- Set 5: 80% × 5 (back-off set — same load as Set 2, faster)

**B. ➕ Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)**

- Set 1: 77% × 5 (lats and glutes braced before the press starts)
- Set 2: 80% × 5 (drive bar past the face — don't drift it forward)
- Set 3: 80% × 4 (full lockout — arms straight, head through, bar directly overhead)
- Set 4: 77% × 5 (back-off — same load as Set 1)

Rest: 3 min between A and B blocks.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — carries and anti-rotation to close the session

Rest: 2 min

**➕ Farmer's Carry (Double Kettlebell)**

- Set 1: 40m (heavy KB — near grip failure by the end is the target)
- Set 2: 40m (same weight — don't reduce)
- Set 3: 40m
- Set 4: 40m (log KB weight — this is the carry number for next session)

**➕ Pallof Press (Cable)**

- Set 1: 3/side × 5 (press out, hold 2 sec, return — hips still)
- Set 2: 3/side × 5
- Set 3: 3/side × 5

## 🧮 SAVE

The ledger only works if you write in it. Log every set. The Front Squat and the OHP are two ends of the same structural demand — if one is ahead of the other, the gap shows up here. Track both.
