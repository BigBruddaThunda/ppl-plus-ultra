# ➕ Barless Power Standard ➕

Bodyweight full-body power | Core, hip power, upper body carry | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➕🟢

> "The bar is gone. The strength standard isn't."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — set the positions without equipment

- 10 Hollow Body Rock (full brace — the anti-extension demand runs through this whole session)
- 10/side Bird Dog Hold (5 sec hold — spine still, no hip rotation)
- 10 Dead Bug (lower back sealed throughout — breathe short, brace constant)
- 30 sec Dead Hang (if bar available — breathe into the stretch, not through it)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — the bar is absent; the difficulty standard isn't

Rest: 3 min between sets. ⛽ Strength rest holds even without the bar.

**➕ L-Sit (Parallel Bars or Floor)**

The closest bodyweight equivalent to loaded core compression.

- Set 1: max hold (legs straight or tucked — full hip flexion if possible)
- Set 2: max hold (same position — a tuck that holds 20 sec beats a straight-leg that collapses at 5)
- Set 3: max hold
- Set 4: max hold
- Set 5: max hold (log each time — this is a trackable number)

**➕ Hanging Leg Raise (Straight)**

- Set 1: 5 reps (dead hang start — no kip, controlled lowering)
- Set 2: 5 reps (pause 1 sec at top — full hip flexion expressed)
- Set 3: 5 reps
- Set 4: 5 reps
- Set 5: 5 reps (if straight-leg breaks down, bent-knee is the honest progression)

Rest: 3 min between all sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — anti-extension and anti-rotation to close

Rest: 2 min

**➕ RKC Plank (Hardstyle)**

Not a normal plank. Squeeze everything — glutes, abs, quads — until the floor shakes.

- Set 1: 20 sec (max-tension isometric — it should be uncomfortable)
- Set 2: 20 sec
- Set 3: 20 sec
- Set 4: 20 sec (log if tension drops before time — that is the real measure)

**➕ Windshield Wiper (Hanging)**

Anti-rotation and rotational control back to back with the same hang.

- Set 1: 4/side (controlled arc — hips drive the rotation, not momentum)
- Set 2: 4/side
- Set 3: 4/side

## 4. 🚂 JUNCTION

```
Date: ___________
L-Sit: best hold ___sec / tuck or straight?
Hanging Leg Raise: reps × sets completed
RKC Plank: hold time / tension held Y/N
Location: ___________
```

- ⛽🏛➕🔵 — return to barbell; does the bodyweight standard translate?
- ⛽🏛➕⚫ — if L-Sit exposed a mechanics gap, the teaching session addresses it
- 🦋🏛➕🟢 — same format at hypertrophy load; more volume, same equipment

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 🧮 SAVE

The L-Sit is a loaded core hold without load. Every second is work. The number you log today is the number to beat next time. That is what the barless standard means — same accountability, different tools.
