# ➕ Complex Play ➕

**Full-body power exploration | Barbell complexes, carry variations, sandbox core | 60–70 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➕🟡

> "Same constraints. Different order. See what happens."

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
📍 pono — *Set the position. The play starts later.*
⛽🏛➕🟡♨️ (Warm-Up | Full Body Power/Core | Basics | Barbell/Kettlebell)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: None. 8 minutes.

├─ 2 rounds:
│  ├─ 8 ➕ Dead Bug (controlled, lower back floor-sealed)
│  ├─ 8 ➕ Hollow Body Hold — 5 sec each (brace before you lift, not after)
│  ├─ 8 ➕ Kettlebell Swing (Two-Hand) — light (hip hinge pattern — confirms the axis)
│  └─ 6 ➕ Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) — empty bar (position before load)

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
📍 pono — *Set the foundation for the main exploration.*
⛽🏛➕🟡▶️ (Primer | Full Body Power | Basics | Barbell)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: 2 min between sets.

**High Pull (Barbell) — The Power Pattern Behind the Complex**

├─ 3 sets × 5 reps ➕ High Pull (Barbell) — 55–60%
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 55% × 5 (deliberate — feel the hip-to-shrug sequence)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ 58% × 5 (add some speed — this is the movement the complex is built on)
│  └─ Set 3: ⛽ 60% × 5 (primer done — ready to build the complex)

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
📍 pono — *The anchor. The barbell complex as the main event.*
⛽🏛➕🟡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Full Body Power | Basics | Barbell)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: 3–4 min between sets.

**Classic Barbell Complex — 4-Movement Sequence**

*Each movement flows directly into the next. Set the bar down between movements only for grip reset — no extended rest until the round is complete.*

**The Complex (5 reps each movement, one bar, continuous):**

├─ 4 sets of the full sequence:
│  │
│  ├─ 5 ➕ Clean Deadlift (Olympic Stance) (first pull position — drive floor away)
│  ├─ 5 ➕ High Pull (Barbell) (transition from hinge — hips drive, elbows high)
│  ├─ 5 ➕ Front Squat (Core Bracing) (clean the bar, front rack, full depth)
│  └─ 5 ➕ Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) (press from front rack — head through at top)
│
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 60% × (5+5+5+5) (moderate — learn the transitions)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ 65% × (5+5+5+5) (the weak link appears here — don't ignore it)
│  ├─ Set 3: ⛽ 68% × (5+5+5+5) (the press will be hardest — it comes last and you're fatigued)
│  └─ Set 4: ⛽ 70% × (5+5+5+5) (70% complex is real work — every transition deliberate)

**Coaching note:** The load is governed by the weakest movement in the chain. In this complex, the Overhead Press is typically the limiting factor. Do not let the deadlift drive you to a weight you cannot press. The load is the press weight, not the deadlift weight.

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 4. 🏖 SANDBOX
📍 pono — *Constrained exploration. Choose one variation. Stay within 75–85%.*
⛽🏛➕🟡🏖 (Sandbox | Full Body Power | Basics | Barbell/Kettlebell)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**🔠 Choice — Pick One Carry Variation to Explore:**

*Option A: Rack Carry (Double Kettlebell)*
Two kettlebells in front rack. Heavy. Walk 30m × 4 sets.
(shoulders locked into position — don't let the bells pull the elbows down)

*Option B: Mixed Carry (Rack + Overhead)*
One KB in rack, one KB overhead. 20m each side × 3 sets.
(the offset creates rotational demand — resist it without leaning)

*Option C: Overhead Carry (Single Kettlebell)*
One arm overhead, arm stacked, 30m × 4 sets each arm.
(wrist straight, shoulder packed, eyes forward — this is a core exercise disguised as a carry)

**Choose one. Do the sets. Note which carry exposed a weakness.**

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
📍 pono — *Non-redundant core work. Quick and deliberate.*
⛽🏛➕🟡🧩 (Supplemental | Core | Basics | Bodyweight/Cable)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: 2 min between sets.

**A — Turkish Get-Up (Full) — Single-Arm KB**
*Full-body integration. Every position in the get-up is a moment of precision.*

├─ 3 sets × 3/side ➕ Turkish Get-Up (Full) — moderate KB
│  ├─ Set 1: (slow — pause at each position, confirm before moving on)
│  ├─ Set 2: (same weight — speed is not the goal here)
│  └─ Set 3: (the final position tells you how fatigued the shoulder is — note it)

**B — Hanging Leg Raise (Straight)**
*Core finisher. Hip flexors and anterior chain after the complex.*

├─ 3 sets × 5 reps ➕ Hanging Leg Raise (Straight)
│  ├─ Set 1: (control the lowering — don't let legs drop)
│  ├─ Set 2: (same form — slow and deliberate)
│  └─ Set 3: (pause 1 sec at top — full hip flexion expressed)

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 6. 🚂 JUNCTION
📍 pono — *Log the exploration. Position it for the next session.*
═══════════════════════════════════════

**Session log:**
├─ Complex: working weight at each set / which movement was the limiting factor?
├─ Sandbox carry: which variation chosen / weight used / any asymmetry noted?
├─ Turkish Get-Up: KB weight / position where form broke (if any)?
├─ Hanging Leg Raise: reps completed / kipping Y/N?

**What the Sandbox told you:**
The carry variation you chose and how it felt is information. Weakness in overhead position suggests shoulder stability gaps. Weakness in rack carry suggests upper back. Asymmetry in mixed carry suggests rotational bias. This is the diagnostic function of the Fun color.

**Next sessions:**
├─ Next → ⛽🏛➕🔵 — convert today's complex into a structured, logged progression
├─ Next → ⛽🏛➕🟣 — Olympic lift entry to build on the High Pull primer work
└─ Next → ⛽🏛➕🔴 — bring the complex to intensity: higher load, fewer rest breaks

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 🧮 SAVE
═══════════════════════════════════════

The barbell complex is the most honest test of full-body power integration without Olympic lift mechanics. The limiting movement is always the most useful data point. Write it down.
