# ➕ Complex Play ➕

Full-body power exploration | Barbell complex, carry sandbox, Turkish Get-Up | 60–70 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➕🟡

> "Same constraints. Different order. See what happens."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — set the position before the play starts

- 2 rounds:
  - 8 Dead Bug (controlled, lower back sealed to floor)
  - 6 Hollow Body Hold (5 sec each — brace before you lift, not after)
  - 8 Kettlebell Swing (Two-Hand) at light weight (hip hinge — confirms the axis)
  - 6 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) at empty bar (position before load)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — the barbell complex is the anchor. Stay within the strength ceiling.

Rest: 3–4 min between sets.

**Classic Barbell Complex — 4-Movement Sequence**

The load is governed by the weakest movement in the chain. The Overhead Press is typically the limiting factor — load to the press, not the deadlift.

Each movement flows directly into the next. Set bar down only for grip reset.

- Set 1: 60% × (5 Clean Deadlift + 5 High Pull + 5 Front Squat + 5 Overhead Press) (learn the transitions)
- Set 2: 65% × (5 + 5 + 5 + 5) (the weak link appears here — don't ignore it)
- Set 3: 68% × (5 + 5 + 5 + 5) (the press comes last and you're fatigued — it will show)
- Set 4: 70% × (5 + 5 + 5 + 5) (top set — every transition deliberate)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🏖 SANDBOX

📍 pono — constrained exploration. Choose one carry variation. Stay within the strength ceiling.

Rest: 3 min between sets.

Pick one option and run the prescribed sets.

**Option A — Rack Carry (Double Kettlebell)**
Two kettlebells in front rack. Heavy. 30m × 4 sets.
(shoulders locked into position — don't let the bells pull the elbows down)

**Option B — Mixed Carry (Rack + Overhead)**
One KB in rack, one KB overhead. 20m each side × 3 sets.
(the offset load creates rotational demand — resist it without leaning)

**Option C — Overhead Carry (Single Kettlebell)**
One arm overhead, arm stacked. 30m × 4 sets each arm.
(wrist straight, shoulder packed — this is a core exercise wearing a carry disguise)

Choose one. Run the sets. Note which carry exposed a weakness.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — full-body integration and hip flexor finisher

Rest: 2 min

**➕ Turkish Get-Up (Full) — Single-Arm KB**

- Set 1: 3/side (slow — pause at each position, confirm before moving on)
- Set 2: 3/side (same weight — speed is not the goal)
- Set 3: 3/side (the final position tells you how fatigued the shoulder is — note it)

**➕ Hanging Leg Raise (Straight)**

- Set 1: 5 reps (control the lowering — don't let legs drop)
- Set 2: 5 reps (pause 1 sec at top — full hip flexion expressed)
- Set 3: 5 reps

## 🧮 SAVE

The barbell complex is the most honest test of full-body power integration without Olympic lift mechanics. The limiting movement is always the most useful data point. The carry sandbox tells you where structural gaps live. Both findings go into the next session.
