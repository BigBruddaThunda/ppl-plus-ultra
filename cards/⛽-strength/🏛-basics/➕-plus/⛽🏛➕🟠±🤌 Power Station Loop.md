# ➕ Power Station Loop ➕

Circuit full-body power | Kettlebell and bodyweight, tissue rotation | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➕🟠

> "Five stations. One rule: the tissue changes every time."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — short and deliberate; the loop runs on momentum

- 2 rounds:
  - 8 Hollow Body Rock (full brace — anti-extension demand runs through the whole loop)
  - 8/side Bird Dog Hold (3 sec each — spine still)
  - 10 Kettlebell Swing (Two-Hand) at light weight (hip drive, not squat — confirm the hinge)
  - 10 Dead Bug (lower back sealed to floor)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — one set at each station before the loop starts

Rest: 60 sec between stations.

- Station 1 primer: 8 Kettlebell Swing (Two-Hand) — light (confirm hip hinge)
- Station 2 primer: 5 Ab Wheel Rollout (Anti-Extension) — from knees (confirm anti-extension)
- Station 3 primer: 15m/side Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm) — light (confirm anti-lateral)
- Station 4 primer: 5 Hanging Leg Raise (Straight) — controlled (confirm hanging stability)
- Station 5 primer: 5/side Pallof Press (Cable) — light (confirm anti-rotation)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🎱 ARAM

🤌 facio — tissue rotation loop. No two adjacent stations target the same system.

```
Station 1 — Hip Power (Posterior Chain)
Kettlebell Swing (Two-Hand) — moderate-heavy
(explosive hip snap — height comes from the hip, not the arms)

Station 2 — Anti-Extension Core (Anterior Core)
Ab Wheel Rollout (Anti-Extension) — from knees
(slow out to end range, pull back with lats — not a speed exercise)

Station 3 — Anti-Lateral / Loaded Carry (Lateral Core + Grip)
Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm) — heavy KB — 20m alternating side
(vertical spine — don't lean away from the load)

Station 4 — Hip Flexion / Hanging Core (Hip Flexors + Rectus)
Hanging Leg Raise (Straight) — pull-up bar
(dead hang start, controlled lowering — no kipping)

Station 5 — Anti-Rotation (Rotational Core)
Pallof Press (Cable) — alternate sides each round
(press out, hold 2 sec, return — hips absolutely still)

→ return to Station 1 for next round
```

Rest between stations: 15 sec (rotate and set up)
Rest between rounds: 3 min — ⛽ Strength rest holds in the circuit

Run 4 complete rounds.

Loop tissue audit: posterior chain → anterior core → lateral core → hip flexors → rotational core → no two adjacent stations match.

## 4. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — the loop hit everything. Release it.

- 60 sec Child's Pose (Core Release) (arms overhead — anterior chain decompresses)
- 60 sec/side Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch (four rounds of hanging leg raises loaded these)
- 60 sec Foam Roll Abs (slow — the rollouts created tension here)
- 5 breaths Diaphragmatic Breathing (inhale into the belly — not the chest)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🚂 JUNCTION

```
Date: ___________
KB Swing: weight ___ / form held all 4 rounds Y/N
Ab Wheel: range of motion / form breakdown Y/N
Suitcase Carry: KB weight ___ / lateral lean controlled Y/N
Hanging Leg Raise: reps per round ___ / kipping Y/N
Station that fatigued first: ___________
```

- ⛽🏛➕🟣 — Olympic lift entry for the hip power expressed at Station 1
- ⛽🏛🪡🟠 — pull circuit to complement today's core and carry work

## 🧮 SAVE

A circuit is a tissue rotation system, not a list of exercises done quickly. Each station gave the previous one a full recovery window. That is why the load stayed heavy all four rounds. The station that fatigued first tells you where to direct structural work.
