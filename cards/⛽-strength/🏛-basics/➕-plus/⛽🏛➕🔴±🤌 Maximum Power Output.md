# ➕ Maximum Power Output ➕

Intense full-body power | Power Clean complex, Overhead Press, Carries | 75–85 min

CODE: ⛽🏛➕🔴

> "Output is the only metric today."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — the warm-up matches the session

- 2 rounds:
  - 10 Hollow Body Rock (ribs down, lower back locked)
  - 8 Hang Clean Pull (Above Knee) at empty bar (explosive hip drive, shrug)
  - 6 Front Squat (Core Bracing) at empty bar (brace before descent)
  - 6 Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) at empty bar (full extension at lockout)
- 3 × Power Clean (GOLD) at 50% (rehearse the catch before loading)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — CNS potentiation before the complex

Rest: 2 min between primer sets.

**➕ Clean Pull (From Floor) — Acceleration Primer (GOLD)**

Intentionally loaded heavier than the working Clean weight. After the pull overload, the complex weight feels lighter.

- Set 1: 80% × 4 (full extension — heels rise, elbows high at top)
- Set 2: 83% × 4 (faster than Set 1 — same positions, more speed)
- Set 3: 85% × 4 (maximum pull speed)

Rest: 3 min before 🧈.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — maximum power output. Explosive every rep. No grinding.

Rest: 2–3 min between sets. 🔴 Intense — rest is reduced.

**A — ➕ Power Clean + Front Squat Complex (GOLD)**

Two movements, one bar. No rest between movements within each set.

- Set 1: 75% × (4 Power Clean + 2 Front Squat) (clean the bar, front squat, return — one sequence)
- Set 2: 76% × (4 + 2) (front squats after the cleans — legs already loaded)
- Set 3: 78% × (4 + 2) (elbows stay high through both movements)
- Set 4: 79% × (4 + 2) (if the front squat position collapses, reduce load next session)
- Set 5: 80% × (4 + 2) (full output on the cleans, depth on the squats)

**B — ➕ Barbell Overhead Press (Standing)**

After the complex. Tests total-body tension under accumulated fatigue.

- Set 1: 78% × 4 (lats and glutes — the press is a total-body event)
- Set 2: 80% × 4 (drive bar past the face, don't drift it forward)
- Set 3: 82% × 4 (push through the sticking point — no layback)
- Set 4: 83% × 4 (near max effort for 4 reps — treat it that way)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — carries and anti-rotation. Short rest.

Rest: 90 sec between sets.

**➕ Farmer's Carry (Double Kettlebell) + ➕ Pallof Press (Cable) — Superset**

Carry first, press second. No rest between A and B within each pair.

- Pair 1: 30m Farmer's Carry → 5/side Pallof Press (press out, hold 2 sec)
- Pair 2: 30m Farmer's Carry → 5/side Pallof Press (heavier KB if grip held)
- Pair 3: 30m Farmer's Carry → 5/side Pallof Press
- Pair 4: 30m Farmer's Carry → 5/side Pallof Press (final pair — hold the carry until done)

Rest: 90 sec between pairs.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🌋 GUTTER

🤌 facio — all out. One set. The power ceiling for this block.

Rest: 4 full minutes before this block.

**➕ Clean Pull (From Floor) — Max Load (GOLD)**

- 1 set × 4 reps at 90–95% (full extension every rep — this is raw hip drive at maximum load)

Log this weight. It is the power ceiling for this training block.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE

🤌 facio — CNS debt is real. Discharge the output.

- 90 sec Child's Pose (Core Release) (arms overhead — decompress)
- 60 sec/side Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch (hips drove hard today)
- 60 sec Supine Spinal Twist (30 sec/side)
- 5 slow breaths Diaphragmatic Breathing (exhale fully — longer than inhale)

## 🧮 SAVE

The complex and the Gutter pull are two ends of the same demand: skill-under-load and raw power ceiling. Both numbers matter. The gap between them is your technical efficiency score.
