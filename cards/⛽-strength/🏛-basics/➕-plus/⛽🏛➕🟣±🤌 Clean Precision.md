> "One position at a time. The speed comes from getting the positions right, not from skipping them."

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🤌 facio — the bar path is the work today; it starts here

Technical gate: 3 reps at empty bar. Check bar path against these two points:
- Bar stays over mid-foot from floor to knee
- Elbows pull back and down at the catch — not out

If bar path is off on the empty bar, fix it before loading.

- 6 Hang Clean Pull (Above Knee) (empty bar — hip extension to shrug, elbows back)
- 6 Power Clean (empty bar — receive with soft knees, full front rack)
- 6 Overhead Squat (empty bar — active shoulders, press the bar up through the descent)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🤌 facio — build to working load with technical focus at each stop

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**➕ Power Clean (GOLD)**

- Set 1: 55% × 3 (deliberate — set the hip position before each rep)
- Set 2: 65% × 3 (add speed on the second pull — hips drive first)
- Set 3: 72% × 2 (approach weight — confirm catch before the working sets)

If the catch collapses at 72%, stay at 65% for the working sets.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🤌 facio — quality over volume. Every rep gets a technical finding.

Rest: 4–5 min between sets. 🟣 Technical — the rest is mandatory, not optional.

**➕ Power Clean (GOLD)**

- Set 1: 75% × 4 (bar path clean — note any drift)
- Set 2: 77% × 4 (faster second pull — extension first, then pull under)
- Set 3: 79% × 4 (if mechanics hold, proceed to Set 4)
- Set 4: 80% × 4 (top set — log the technical finding from this set)
- Set 5: 75% × 4 (back-off — same load as Set 1, more speed)

After each set: name what happened. One thing.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🤌 facio — overhead and carry work to complement the clean

Rest: 3 min

**➕ Overhead Squat**

- Set 1: 50% × 4 (active overhead press throughout the descent — not passive)
- Set 2: 55% × 4 (depth reveals shoulder mobility — note it)
- Set 3: 55% × 4 (the overhead squat is a full-body technical test, not a leg exercise)

**➕ Farmer's Carry (Double Kettlebell)**

- Set 1: 30m (heavy — vertical torso, short steps, grip doesn't dictate posture)
- Set 2: 30m
- Set 3: 30m (log KB weight)

## 🧮 SAVE

The Power Clean is the most technically demanding movement in the basic repertoire. Every rep teaches something. The back-off set at the end should feel faster than Set 1 — if it doesn't, the session burned too much precision into the top sets. Adjust next time.
