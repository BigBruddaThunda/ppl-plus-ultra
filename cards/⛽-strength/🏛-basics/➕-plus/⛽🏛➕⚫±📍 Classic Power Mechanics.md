# ➕ Classic Power Mechanics ➕

**Teaching full-body power mechanics | Core bracing, hip drive, barbell integration | 70–80 min**

CODE: ⛽🏛➕⚫

> "Learn where the power actually comes from before you load it."

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
📍 pono — *Set the position before you move.*
⛽🏛➕⚫♨️ (Warm-Up | Full Body Power/Core | Basics | Dumbbells/Barbell)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: None. Move continuously for 8–10 minutes.

├─ 2 rounds:
│  ├─ 10 ➕ Cat-Cow (Core Mobility) (slow, breathe into lower back)
│  ├─ 10 ➕ Bird Dog Hold — 3 sec hold each side (opposite arm-leg, flat spine)
│  ├─ 8 ➕ Barbell Rollout (Anti-Extension) — empty bar (brace before you extend)
│  └─ 10/side ➕ Half-Kneeling Pallof Press (Cable) — light (stand tall, don't rotate)

**Coaching note:** The warm-up is movement vocabulary. You are learning the shapes of the workout before load arrives.

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
📍 pono — *Neural potentiation. The CNS wakes up here.*
⛽🏛➕⚫▶️ (Primer | Full Body Power | Basics | Barbell)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: 90 sec between sets.

**Clean-Grip High Pull from Hang — Barbell, sub-maximal**

*This is the pulling pattern behind every barbell power movement. Learn it here, unloaded.*

├─ 3 sets × 4 reps ➕ High Pull (Barbell) — 40% of clean 1RM
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 40% × 4 (hinge, then shrug, then elbows high)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ 40% × 4 (hips extend first — arms follow)
│  └─ Set 3: ⛽ 45% × 4 (speed from the hip, not the arms)

**Coaching note:** If the bar drifts away from the body during the pull, the hips didn't drive enough. Reset and slow it down. The load is irrelevant here — the pattern is not.

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 3. 🛠 CRAFT
📍 pono — *Skill acquisition. Comprehension over output.*
⛽🏛➕⚫🛠 (Craft | Full Body Power/Core | Basics | Barbell/Dumbbells)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: 3–4 min between each complex segment. This is not a conditioning block — it is a teaching block. Do not rush.

**Barbell Pull-Through Complex — Teaching the clean-grip chain**

*Each segment teaches one position in the barbell power continuum. Done in sequence as a positional drill, not a circuit.*

**Segment A — The Hinge**
├─ 4 sets × 5 reps ➕ Clean Deadlift (Olympic Stance) — 60–65%
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 60% × 5 (arms straight cables, back set hard)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 5 (hips back and down to set position)
│  ├─ Set 3: ⛽ 63% × 5 (drive floor away, extend through the hip)
│  └─ Set 4: ⛽ 65% × 5 (bar stays close — drag it up the shin)

*Rest 3 min.*

**Segment B — The Drive**
├─ 3 sets × 5 reps ➕ Barbell Overhead Press (Standing) — 65% of OHP 1RM
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 5 (lats locked before you press, not after)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 5 (head through at the top, don't lean back)
│  └─ Set 3: ⛽ 68% × 5 (whole body tight, legs loaded not locked)

*Rest 3 min.*

**Segment C — The Carry**
├─ 3 sets × 30m ➕ Farmer's Carry (Double Kettlebell) — heavy but controlled
│  ├─ Set 1: (shoulder blades together, chin level)
│  ├─ Set 2: (breathe at the turnaround, not during)
│  └─ Set 3: (short steps, vertical torso)

**Coaching note on the complex:** These three segments — hinge, press, carry — represent the three expressions of full-body power in 🏛 Basics. The clean pulls from the floor. The press drives overhead. The carry demonstrates total-system integration under load. Each deserves full attention.

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 4. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
📍 pono — *The main work. Teaching pace. Never rush a set.*
⛽🏛➕⚫🧈 (Bread & Butter | Full Body Power | Basics | Barbell)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: 3–4 min between all sets. Use full rest — the point is quality, not fatigue accumulation.

**Barbell Front Squat (Core Bracing)**
*Primary vehicle for teaching spinal integrity under axial load.*

├─ 5 sets × 4 reps ➕ Front Squat (Core Bracing) — 75–80%
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 4 (elbows up and forward — the rack position holds you)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 4 (knees track toes, hips sink evenly)
│  ├─ Set 3: ⛽ 77% × 4 (brace before descent, hold brace on the way up)
│  ├─ Set 4: ⛽ 79% × 4 (if elbows drop, the weight is too heavy)
│  └─ Set 5: ⛽ 80% × 4 (this is a bracing lesson that happens to be a squat)

**Coaching note:** The front squat is used here — not the back squat — because it exposes bracing failures immediately. If the torso collapses forward, the load falls. The bar teaches the position. You can not cheat the front squat.

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
📍 pono — *Secondary work. Non-redundant. Builds what the main work relies on.*
⛽🏛➕⚫🧩 (Supplemental | Core/Anti-Rotation | Basics | Dumbbells/Bodyweight)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Rest: 2–3 min between sets.

**A — Anti-Rotation Core**
├─ 3 sets × 8/side ➕ Pallof Press (Cable) — light to moderate
│  ├─ Set 1: ⛽ light × 8/side (pause 2 sec at full extension)
│  ├─ Set 2: ⛽ moderate × 8/side (the movement happens in the arms — not the trunk)
│  └─ Set 3: ⛽ moderate × 8/side (stand tall throughout, no hip shift)

**B — Anti-Extension Core**
├─ 3 sets × 6 reps ➕ Ab Wheel Rollout (Anti-Extension) — from knees
│  ├─ Set 1: (reach until hollow body breaks — stop there)
│  ├─ Set 2: (exhale on the way out, brace harder going back)
│  └─ Set 3: (controlled speed both ways — no momentum)

**Coaching note:** These two movements address what the front squat demands: anterior bracing and rotational resistance. They are not accessory work. They are the engine behind the main lift.

═══════════════════════════════════════
## 6. 🚂 JUNCTION
📍 pono — *Bridge forward. Log before you leave.*
═══════════════════════════════════════

**Session log:**
├─ High Pull: top weight used / any breakdown in hip drive Y/N
├─ Clean Deadlift: working weight / back position notes
├─ Overhead Press: working weight / elbow flare Y/N
├─ Front Squat: working weight / elbows stayed up Y/N
├─ Pallof Press: resistance used
├─ Ab Wheel: range of motion achieved

**What this session built:**
The three-segment craft block taught the three positions of full-body barbell power. The front squat stress-tested bracing under load. The supplemental work identified specific weaknesses in anti-extension and anti-rotation.

**Next sessions:**
├─ Next → ⛽🏛➕🔵 — same power track with structured progression, no more teaching pace
├─ Next → ⛽🏛🪡🔵 — vertical and horizontal pulls to balance the pressing done here
└─ Next → ⛽🏛🍗🔵 — lower body power to complement the front squat bracing work

## 🧮 SAVE
═══════════════════════════════════════

Full-body power in ⚫ Teaching is not remedial work. The positions learned here under sub-maximal load are the same positions that carry heavy loads in every other address. Take the time now, pay less later.
