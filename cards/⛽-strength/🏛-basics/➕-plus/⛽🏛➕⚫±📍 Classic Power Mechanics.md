> "Learn the sequence before you load it — the complex only works if every segment does."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

📍 pono — set the positions the complex will demand

- 10 Dead Bug (slow, lower back sealed — confirm anti-extension before anything else)
- 10 Air Squat (depth below parallel, knees track toes)
- 6 Hollow Body Hold (5 sec each — brace before lifting, not during)
- 8 Hang Clean Pull (Above Knee) (empty bar — hip drive, shrug, feel the sequence)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🛠 CRAFT

📍 pono — position is the product. Load stays at 40–55%. Each segment gets its own set.

Rest: unlimited between teaching sets.

**The Clean Deadlift Complex — taught in three segments:**

**Segment 1: Hinge**
- 3 × 4 ➕ Clean Deadlift (Olympic Stance) at 45–50%
  - Focus: first pull position, bar over mid-foot, hips back — not down
  - After each set: name what broke. Reset before loading more.

**Segment 2: Drive**
- 3 × 4 ➕ High Pull (Barbell) at 50%
  - Focus: hip-to-shrug sequence — the pull doesn't start with the arms
  - The elbows come up after the hips extend, not before

**Segment 3: Carry**
- 3 × 20m ➕ Farmer's Carry (Double Kettlebell) — moderate
  - Focus: vertical torso, short steps, grip doesn't dictate posture

Run all three segments before moving to 🧈.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

📍 pono — apply the mechanics under working load

Rest: 3–4 min between sets.

**➕ Barbell Complex — Hinge + Drive combined (3-movement, one bar)**

Each movement flows into the next. Set bar down only for grip reset between reps if needed.

- Set 1: 55% × 4 Clean Deadlift + 4 High Pull (feel the transition)
- Set 2: 60% × 4 + 4 (the hinge positions the drive — check if that's happening)
- Set 3: 62% × 4 + 4 (if the pull breaks, the hinge broke first — watch for it)
- Set 4: 65% × 4 + 4 (top set — same mechanics, more load)

Then:

**➕ Front Squat (Core Bracing)**

- Set 1: 70% × 5 (full front rack, elbows high — not parallel to floor)
- Set 2: 75% × 5 (out of the hole: chest leads, hips follow)
- Set 3: 75% × 4 (log which cue helped most)

Rest: 3 min.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

📍 pono — anchor the anti-rotation work while the movement pattern is fresh

Rest: 2 min

**➕ Pallof Press (Cable)**

- Set 1: 3/side × 5 (press out, hold 2 sec — hips don't move)
- Set 2: 3/side × 5 (same load — feel the difference between sides)
- Set 3: 3/side × 5 (the drill is the rep count, not the load)

**➕ Ab Wheel Rollout (Anti-Extension)**

- Set 1: 3 × 5 (slow out to end range — pull back with lats, not hip flexors)
- Set 2: 3 × 5
- Set 3: 3 × 5

## 5. 🚂 JUNCTION

```
Date: ___________
Complex top set: ___% — segment that broke: ___________
Front Squat top set: ___  ×  ___
Cue that clicked today: ___________
Correct next session: ___________
```

Next →
- ⛽🏛➕🔵 — same complex with structured loading once mechanics are clean
- ⛽🏛➕🟣 — technical path: Olympic lift entry after the hinge is sound
- 🐂🏛➕⚫ — return to foundation load if any segment needs more drilling time

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 🧮 SAVE

The complex teaches the relationship between the hinge and the drive. If the hinge breaks, the drive has nothing to build on. The work here is not about load — it is about sequence. Sequence first, load later.
