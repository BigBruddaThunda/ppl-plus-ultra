# 🪡 The Pull Playground — Functional Variations 🪡

Varied unilateral pull exploration | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | 50–60 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🪡🟡

> "Same muscle groups, different conversations. Find out which ones you've been ignoring."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🟡🔨🪡♨️ (Warm-Up | Playful Prep | Functional Bias | Bodyweight/Band)

Rest: Move — no timer, no structure. Explore the movement space.

├─ Dead Hang × 30 sec (just hang — decompress, breathe, feel the shoulder capsule)
├─ Brachial CARs × 8/side (full shoulder circle in the socket — slow and deliberate)
├─ 2 × 8 Inverted Row (try two different grip widths — notice the difference)
│   (wide grip = more rear delt. Narrow = more lat. File that away.)
├─ 2 × 5 Around-the-World Pull-Up (single-arm emphasis at each point)
│   (if this is new, just travel one direction slowly)
└─ Band Shoulder External Rotation × 10/side (loosen the rotator cuff before the pulling work)

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🟡🔨🪡▶️ (Primer | Strength Potentiation | Varied Bias | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 90 sec — casual but present.

🧸 fero — carry your curiosity from the warmup into the working weight.

**A. 🪡 Gorilla Row (alternating) — Strength Ramp**
- Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 5/side (alternating — feel the anti-rotation brace)
- Set 2: ⛽ 72% × 4/side (same — notice which side initiates differently)

*Coaching cue:* "The Gorilla Row is slightly chaotic by design. Don't fight the chaos — manage it."

**B. 🪡 Rope Climb (if available) — 1 × 1 ascent**
- Arm over arm — controlled up, controlled down
- If no rope: Towel Pull-Up × 5 (grip and forearm activation)

---

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🟡🔨🪡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Main Strength Pull | Variety Within Constraints | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 3–4 min between sets. The variety is in exercise selection — not in laxer rest.

**A. 🪡 Incline Dumbbell Row — Angle Variation**

Lie prone on an incline bench (30–45°). Both arms hang. Pull single-arm, strict.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5/side (chest against pad — no hip drive, no assist)
- Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5/side (this angle removes all body English — what you pull, the lat pulled)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4/side (elbow past back-line — if it doesn't, too heavy)
- Set 4: ⛽ 80% × 4/side (same quality — confirm, don't push)

*Coaching cue:* "The incline removes the lie. You can't swing, you can't hinge, you can't borrow. Just pull."

**B. 🪡 Elbow-Out Dumbbell Row — Rear Delt Emphasis**

Same setup as a standard dumbbell row but elbow flares out slightly, targeting rear delt and mid-trap.

- Set 1: ⛽ 72% × 5/side (lighter than standard row — the angle reduces mechanical advantage)
- Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 5/side (elbow ends level with or slightly above shoulder)
- Set 3: ⛽ 75% × 4/side (feel the posterior shoulder working — different texture than a lat row)

*Coaching cue:* "It should feel like a face pull done with a dumbbell from a bent-over position. Rear delt, not lat."

## 4. 🏖 SANDBOX

🟡🔨🪡🏖 (Sandbox | Constrained Exploration | Functional Pull | Any Available Equipment)

This block is bounded play. The constraint: everything must be a unilateral pulling pattern. Within that, choose freely. Try things you've avoided.

Rest: Self-directed — but don't rest forever. The sandbox has a 15-min clock.

**Option A — Typewriter Pull-Up**
- 3 × 3 each direction (pull to center, travel to one side, back to center, travel to other, lower)
- If it breaks down before 3, stop and rest — don't push broken reps

**Option B — Single-Arm Cable Row (experiment with handle attachments)**
- Try rope vs. single handle vs. wide grip
- 3 × 5/side with each attachment you want to explore
- Note which one feels like it actually hits the lat

**Option C — Renegade Row (light-moderate)**
- 3 × 4/side (plank position — the anti-rotation demand is the point)
- Hips flat. No rotation. If it twists, lower the load.

**Option D — Plank Row (Single-Arm)**
- 3 × 5/side (high plank position, one dumbbell per hand, alternate pulls)
- The floor-based demand is different from any bench or cable version

*Sandbox rule:* Pick 2 of the 4 options. Do them. Log what you find.

## 🧮 SAVE

The sandbox exercises are not warm-ups or filler — they are reconnaissance. What you find in this session tells you what deserves to be in the structured sessions.
