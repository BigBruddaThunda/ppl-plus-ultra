# 🪡 Towel Inverted Row Progression — Upper Back and Biceps, No Equipment 🪡

Calisthenic strength pulling | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | 50–60 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🪡🟢

> "The bar tells you what your back can actually do without the iron to hide behind."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🟢🔨🪡♨️ (Warm-Up | Back Activation | Functional Bias | Bodyweight)

Rest: Move continuously.

├─ 3 × 8 Scapular Pull-Up (dead hang, pure scapular depression — no elbow bend)
│   (shoulders away from ears, then back down — that's it)
├─ 2 × 10 Dead Hang (30 sec each — decompress the spine, breathe)
├─ 2 × 8 Inverted Row (feet on floor, body plank — light angle)
│   (chest to bar, pause at top)
└─ 2 × 6/side Towel Pull-Up (grip work — one hand on the bar, one on a hanging towel)
   (this is the primer for archer pull-up demands)

---

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🟢🔨🪡▶️ (Primer | CNS Activation | Unilateral Bias | Bodyweight)

Rest: 90 sec. Full range each set.

🧸 fero — carry the bilateral base into the unilateral work ahead.

**A. 🪡 Pull-Up (Overhand Grip) — Moderate Sets**
- Set 1: ⛽ 4 reps (full hang to chin over bar — no kip)
- Set 2: ⛽ 4 reps (same — feel the lat, not just the arm)

*Coaching cue:* "Elbows to hips, not to waist. Drive them down and back."

**B. 🪡 Typewriter Pull-Up — Lateral Load Prep**
- Set 1: ⛽ 3 reps each direction (pull to center, travel laterally, return)
- Set 2: ⛽ 3 reps each direction (controlled travel — no drop)

*Coaching cue:* "This isn't a trick. It's the gateway to archer work. Take it seriously."

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Inverted Row**
🟢🔨🪡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Main Strength Pull | Unilateral Calisthenics | Bodyweight)

Rest: 3–4 min between sets. This is strength work — treat it that way.

**A. 🪡 Archer Pull-Up — Primary**

One arm performs the full range. The other arm extends out to the side, pressing into the bar for counterbalance. This is unilateral bodyweight strength at its most direct.

- Set 1: ⛽ 4/side (full hang start — don't cheat the bottom position)
- Set 2: ⛽ 4/side (straight arm out to the side — actively push into the bar)
- Set 3: ⛽ 3/side (if form degrades before rep 4, stop at 3)
- Set 4: ⛽ 3/side (quality is the ceiling — no grinding reps here)

*Coaching cue:* "The extended arm is working. It's not a kickstand. If it's passive, you're losing half the movement."

*Scaling:* If Archer Pull-Up isn't yet controlled, sub Typewriter Pull-Up × 5 each direction.

**B. 🪡 Weighted Pull-Up (Belt) — Secondary**

Add load equivalent to ~15–20% bodyweight. This bridges bodyweight strength to loaded pulling.

- Set 1: ⛽ 5 reps (full ROM — dead hang to chin over bar)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 reps (no kip — the weight earns its place with clean reps)
- Set 3: ⛽ 4 reps (if form holds, stay at load — don't add more mid-session)

*Coaching cue:* "Weighted pull-ups show you where the bodyweight version was hiding. The load reveals the weak link."

---

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🟢🔨🪡🧩 (Supplemental | Horizontal + Grip | Functional Bias | Bodyweight/Band)

Rest: 2–3 min.

**A. 🪡 Feet-Elevated Inverted Row**
- Set 1: ⛽ 6 reps (body fully rigid — planked from heel to crown)
- Set 2: ⛽ 6 reps (pause at top — chest to bar, hold for 1 count)
- Set 3: ⛽ 5 reps (if this feels easy with feet elevated, add a plate on the chest)

*Coaching cue:* "Horizontal pull strength transfers to everything athletic. It's not a warmup — it's a movement."

**B. 🪡 Ring Row (Adjustable Angle)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 5 reps (use angle that makes rep 5 honest work)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 reps (same angle — don't shift to easier)
- Set 3: ⛽ 5 reps (elbow path: flare slightly at the end — feel the rear delt finish)

*Coaching cue:* "The rings will wobble. That's not a problem — it's the stabilization demand. Don't fight it into stillness."

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

🟢🔨🪡🪫 (Release | Posterior Chain Discharge | Bodyweight)

Rest: Move slowly. No rush.

├─ 2 × 30 sec Dead Hang (full relaxation — let the spine decompress)
├─ 2 × 10 Scapular CARs (full circular control in the shoulder socket)
│   (forward and backward — equal time)
├─ 1 × 60 sec Hanging Lat Stretch (one hand on bar, lean away — feel the lat lengthen)
│   (breathe into the stretch — don't hold breath)
└─ Cat-Cow × 10 reps (slow — match breath to movement)
   (exhale into cat, inhale into cow)

## 🧮 SAVE

What you can do on a bar without external load is the floor of your pulling capacity. Every kilogram you put on a barbell tomorrow sits on top of what you built here.
