# 🪡 Chest-Supported Single-Arm Row — Lat Strength Log 🪡

Structured unilateral strength pulling | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🪡🔵

> "One arm at a time. Same weight, same reps, same path — until the log proves otherwise."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🔵🔨🪡♨️ (Warm-Up | Posterior Chain Prep | Functional Bias | Dumbbell/Band)

Rest: Continuous movement — 8 min total.

├─ 2 × 10 Band Pull-Apart (horizontal — retract and hold for 1 count)
├─ 2 × 8 Scapular Pull-Up (bar — pure scap movement, no elbow bend)
├─ 2 × 6/side Half-Kneeling Cable Row (light — build the path, not the load)
│   (elbow drives to hip, not elbow drives to ceiling)
└─ 2 × 8 Inverted Row (moderate angle — activate mid-trap and rhomboids)
   (chest to bar, pause at top)

---

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🔵🔨🪡▶️ (Primer | CNS Potentiation | Unilateral Bias | Dumbbell)

Rest: 2 min between sets.

🥨 tendo — extend the range. From prep to working weight, no steps skipped.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row (ramp sets)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 60% × 5/side (establish the position — foot stagger, opposite hand on bench)
- Set 2: ⛽ 68% × 4/side (increase load, same path — notice if position drifts)

*Coaching cue:* "Drive the elbow to the back pocket, not the shoulder to the ear."

---

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Single-Arm Chest-Supported Row**
🔵🔨🪡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary Strength Pulling | Functional Bias | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 3–4 min between all sets. Log every set.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row**
- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 6/side (controlled descent — 2 sec down)
- Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5/side (same path as set 1 — not faster, not sloppier)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 5/side (elbow stays tucked — no flare at the top)
- Set 4: ⛽ 82% × 4/side (if rep 4 breaks down on either side, that's the ceiling)

*Coaching cue:* "Full extension at the bottom. Don't short the range to protect the load."

**B. 🪡 Meadows Row**
- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5/side (stand perpendicular to the bar — load transfers into the lat)
- Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5/side (allow the controlled rotation at the top — that's lat engagement, not a fault)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4/side (elbow ends above back-line — if it doesn't, too heavy)

*Coaching cue:* "This row has a different grip angle than a dumbbell row. Let it. The elbow path is the same."

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🔵🔨🪡🧩 (Supplemental | Rear Chain Accessory | Functional Bias | Cable/Dumbbell)

Rest: 3 min between sets. Non-redundant from Bread & Butter — different muscle emphasis.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Face Pull**
- Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 6/side (rope or single handle — elbow at or above shoulder height)
- Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 6/side (pull to forehead — external rotation at the end)
- Set 3: ⛽ 68% × 5/side (rear delt fires when the elbow is high — let it)

*Coaching cue:* "Thumb to ear. The rotation at the end isn't optional — it's the point."

**B. 🪡 Split-Stance Cable Row**
- Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 5/side (front foot forward, back foot planted — anti-rotation demand)
- Set 2: ⛽ 70% × 5/side (don't let the hip rotate toward the cable — resist it)
- Set 3: ⛽ 70% × 5/side (elbow in tight — lat, not rear delt, does the work here)

*Coaching cue:* "The split stance makes your core a wall. If the wall moves, the load is too heavy."

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

🔵🔨🪡🪫 (Release | Stress Out | Posterior Chain)

Rest: No rush — 6–8 min total.

├─ 2 × 30 sec Dead Hang (full spine decompression — breathe)
├─ Hanging Lat Stretch × 60 sec/side (lean away from the anchored arm)
│   (feel the lat lengthen under bodyweight — don't force it)
├─ 2 × 10 Cat-Cow (slow — reset thoracic mobility after all the rowing)
└─ Foam Roll Lats × 60 sec/side (pin and breathe — not a rolling contest)

Log both sides every time. The gap between your left and right is data — it tells you where strength is being lent and where it needs to be built.
