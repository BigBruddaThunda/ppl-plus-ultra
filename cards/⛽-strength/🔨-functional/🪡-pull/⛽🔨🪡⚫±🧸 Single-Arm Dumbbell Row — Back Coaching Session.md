# 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row — Back Coaching Session 🪡

Single-arm strength pulling | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | 60–70 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🪡⚫

> "Learn where the load actually comes from before you add more of it."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

⚫🔨🪡♨️ (Warm-Up | Back/Shoulder Prep | Functional Bias | Bodyweight/Band)

Rest: Move continuously — no clock.

├─ 5 min light movement: arm circles, scapular CARs, cat-cow
├─ 2 × 10 Band Pull-Apart — feel the mid-trap fire
├─ 2 × 8/side Single-Arm Cable Rear Delt Fly (very light — 20–30% feel only)
│   (retract, not just pull back)
├─ 2 × 6/side Half-Kneeling Cable Row (light — build scapular path awareness)
│   (elbow traces a line from chin to hip)
└─ 2 × 8 Scapular Pull-Up (dead hang, depress and elevate shoulder blades only)
   (no arm bend — pure scap movement)

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

⚫🔨🪡▶️ (Primer | CNS/Motor Pattern | Functional Bias | Dumbbell)

Rest: 90 sec between sets. Full quality on every rep.

🧸 fero — channel the movement pattern before loading it.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row (light — position work)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 50% × 5/side (find the lat, not the shoulder)
- Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 5/side (elbow drives to hip, not to ceiling)

*Coaching cue:* "Think about putting your elbow in your back pocket. Your hand is just along for the ride."

**B. 🪡 Gorilla Row (alternating, moderate load)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 55% × 4/side (brace with the non-pulling side)
- Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 4/side (no rotation — the still side is the anchor)

*Coaching cue:* "The side that isn't rowing should be pulling the floor apart."

---

## 3. 🛠 CRAFT

⚫🔨🪡🛠 (Craft | Mechanics Acquisition | Functional Bias | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 3–4 min. Extended here — comprehension is the priority.

This block teaches before it trains. Reps are moderate load, full attention.

🧸 fero — transfer understanding from slow work to heavy work.

**A. 🪡 Meadows Row — Positioning Drill**

*Setup:* Landmine-style — one end of a barbell in a corner (or use a heavy dumbbell handle parallel to the ground). Stand perpendicular to the bar, foot staggered, ipsilateral hand on bar.

- Set 1: ⛽ 60% × 5/side — pause at the top for 2 seconds (elbows past the hip plane)
- Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 5/side — same pause, feel the thoracic rotation that's allowed

*Coaching cue:* "This row asks your torso to rotate slightly at the top. That's not a mistake — it's the point. Control it. Don't flop into it."

*Check:* Elbow ends above the line of the back. If the elbow is level with the back, the lat is not fully engaged.

**B. 🪡 Half-Kneeling Cable Row — Stability Teaching**

Drop the knee on the same side as the pulling arm. The other leg plants.

- Set 1: ⛽ 60% × 5/side — feel the hip complex stabilize before the arm moves
- Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 5/side — if the pelvis rotates, the weight is too heavy

*Coaching cue:* "Everything below the ribcage should be a statue. Everything above moves."

*Check:* Non-pulling shoulder must stay down. Shrugging on the pull side means trap is doing lat's job.

## 4. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Single-Arm Dumbbell Row**
Primary Pattern: **Single-Arm Dumbbell Row**

⚫🔨🪡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Main Strength Pull | Functional Bias | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 4–5 min between working sets. Teaching color extends rest for full CNS recovery and position check.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row — Working Sets**
- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5/side (set the position, then lift)
- Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5/side (same path — faster isn't better)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4/side (heavier means slower, not sloppier)
- Set 4: ⛽ 80% × 4/side (same load — confirm the movement, don't just survive it)

*Coaching cue between sets:* "Where did the elbow end? Did you feel the lat squeeze or just the bicep?"

**B. 🪡 Kroc Row — Load Transfer**

Same movement pattern, heavier load, controlled aggression.

- Set 1: ⛽ 80% × 5/side (breathe into the brace before each rep)
- Set 2: ⛽ 82% × 4/side (allow slight body lean — that's not a fault, it's leverage)
- Set 3: ⛽ 82% × 4/side (every rep starts from a dead position — no bounce)

*Coaching cue:* "Kroc Row isn't cheating. The shoulder depression at the top is real lat work. Don't let that position collapse."

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

⚫🔨🪡🧩 (Supplemental | Rear Chain Accessory | Functional Bias | Cable/Dumbbell)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Face Pull**
- Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 6/side (elbow at shoulder height or above)
- Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 6/side (pull to forehead, not chin)
- Set 3: ⛽ 65% × 6/side (pause in the contracted position)

*Coaching cue:* "Think 'thumb to ear.' The rotation matters."

**B. 🪡 Alternating Hammer Curl (Standing)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 5/side (neutral grip, no wrist break at the top)
- Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 5/side (hold for a half-second at peak contraction)
- Set 3: ⛽ 65% × 5/side (elbow pinned — if it drifts forward, too heavy)

*Coaching cue:* "Brachialis, not bicep. This builds the thickness, not the peak."

## 🧮 SAVE

Single-arm pulling teaches what bilateral work can hide — one side compensates for the other until you separate them. Whatever you found here, take that information into the next session.
