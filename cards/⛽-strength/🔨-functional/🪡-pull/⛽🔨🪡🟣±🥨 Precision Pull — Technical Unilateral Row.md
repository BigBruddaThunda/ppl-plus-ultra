# 🪡 Precision Pull — Technical Unilateral Row 🪡

Technical strength pulling | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | 55–70 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🪡🟣

> "Fewer reps. More information per rep. The session ends when quality ends."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🟣🔨🪡♨️ (Warm-Up | Precision Prep | Functional Bias | Bodyweight/Cable)

Rest: Deliberate — 60 sec between movements.

├─ 3 × 5 Scapular Pull-Up (pause at each end range — feel the full arc)
├─ 2 × 8 Band Pull-Apart (slow — 3 sec out, 1 sec hold, 3 sec return)
│   (mid-trap must fire before you move on)
├─ 2 × 6/side Half-Kneeling Cable Row (light — map the path you'll use when heavy)
│   (this is reconnaissance, not training)
└─ 2 × 5/side Single-Arm Face Pull (light — external rotation at end range, hold for 2 sec)
   (shoulder needs full rotation capacity before technical work)

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🟣🔨🪡▶️ (Primer | Technical Potentiation | Precision Bias | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 3 min. This primer is loaded — treat each set as a working set of precision work.

🥨 tendo — extend your capacity for quality reps before the main event.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row (technical ramp)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 5/side — film or mirror check: does the elbow track straight?
- Set 2: ⛽ 72% × 4/side — same path at higher load. If it drifts, that's data.

*Technical note:* The elbow should pass behind the line of the shoulder at the top of each rep. If it doesn't, the range is short.

**B. 🪡 Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (bodyweight or light dumbbell)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 2 × 5/side (hinge prep — hamstring and hip stabilizer activation)

*Coaching cue:* "This is not a balance trick. The hip hinge is the point. If you wobble, the hip isn't loaded — the ankle is."

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🟣🔨🪡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary Technical Pull | Precision Bias | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 4–5 min between all sets. Extended technical rest — quality over density.

**A. 🪡 Meadows Row — Technical Standard**

This movement demands the most precision of any single-arm row variation: hip hinge, neutral spine, controlled rotation at the top.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5/side — establish the full movement signature
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 5/side — same signature under higher load
- Set 3: ⛽ 83% × 4/side — if form shifts at this load, this is the ceiling for today
- Set 4: ⛽ 83% × 4/side — confirm, do not exceed

*Technical cue — top position:* Elbow ends above the plane of the back, torso rotates slightly toward the pulling arm. Controlled. Not a fall.

*Technical cue — bottom position:* Full lat stretch. The arm hangs straight. The shoulder doesn't roll forward.

**B. 🪡 Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (Dumbbell)**

Unilateral hip hinge — same-side hand as standing leg. Cross-body demand.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5/side (controlled — the free leg extends back, spine neutral)
- Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5/side (hips level at the bottom — one hip should not hike)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4/side (if the hip hikes, that's the stopping weight)

*Coaching cue:* "The working hamstring should be near full length at the bottom. If it isn't, you're not hinging far enough."

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🟣🔨🪡🧩 (Supplemental | Precision Accessory | Technical Bias | Cable)

Rest: 3–4 min. Precision continues here — no sloppy reps to fill volume.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Lat Pulldown (technical)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 72% × 5/side (full overhead reach at the start — don't shorten the top)
- Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 5/side (elbow to hip — not elbow to lat — the lat IS the hip pull)
- Set 3: ⛽ 75% × 4/side (no lean-back — vertical torso is the technical standard here)

*Coaching cue:* "Staying upright is harder and more correct. Leaning back is borrowing range you didn't earn."

**B. 🪡 Gorilla Row (alternating)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 4/side (brace with the off-side — no rotation between reps)
- Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 4/side (tempo: 1 sec up, 2 sec hold, 2 sec down)
- Set 3: ⛽ 75% × 4/side (if tempo breaks, load is too high)

*Coaching cue:* "The alternating nature makes this a stability test, not just a pulling test."

## 🧮 SAVE

Technical sessions end when form ends — not when the clock says so. The rep count is a ceiling, not a requirement. What you did with clean mechanics is what transfers.
