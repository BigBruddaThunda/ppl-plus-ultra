# 🪡 Slow Eccentric Chin-Up — Lat Control, 4-Second Descent 🪡

Eccentric-emphasis strength pulling | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | 60–70 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🪡⚪

> "The load going down is as much training as the load going up. Give it the same attention."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

⚪🔨🪡♨️ (Warm-Up | Mindful Activation | Slow Tempo | Bodyweight/Band)

Rest: Deliberate — 90 sec between movements. Extended warm-up matches the session tempo.

├─ 5 min: Shoulder CARs (full circle, both directions, 5/side)
│   (breathe into the movement — exhale on the tension point)
├─ 2 × 8 Scapular Pull-Up (3 sec at each end range — no rush)
├─ 2 × 8 slow Cat-Cow (4 sec each direction — breathe matches movement)
│   (exhale into flexion, inhale into extension)
├─ 2 × 6/side Half-Kneeling Cable Row (light — 4 sec return on each rep)
│   (this tempo is the warm-up, not a deviation from it)
└─ Dead Hang × 2 × 30 sec (full spinal decompression — breathe slowly)
   (two breath cycles per hang minimum)

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

⚪🔨🪡▶️ (Primer | Eccentric Preparation | Slow Tempo | Dumbbell)

Rest: 2 min between sets.

🧸 fero — carry the breath pattern from the warm-up into the primer and onward.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row (eccentric emphasis — controlled descent)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 60% × 4/side — 1 sec up, 4 sec down (feel the lat lengthen under load)
- Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 4/side — same tempo (notice: the lat is working hardest on the way down)

*Breathing cue:* "Exhale on the pull. Inhale slowly through the 4-second descent. Do not hold the breath."

---

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Chin-Up (Eccentric)**
⚪🔨🪡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Eccentric Strength | Slow Tempo | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 2–3 min between all sets. Mindful color — rest is extended and quiet. No rushing.

Tempo throughout: 1 sec up — 1 sec hold at top — 4 sec down — 1 sec pause at bottom.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row (tempo)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 72% × 5/side (count the 4 seconds out — don't estimate them)
- Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 5/side (the eccentric at this load will create real sensation — stay with it)
- Set 3: ⛽ 78% × 4/side (if the eccentric tempo breaks, the load is too heavy)
- Set 4: ⛽ 78% × 4/side (same load — confirm the tempo holds at this weight)

*Breathing cue:* "The descent is not rest. Breathe through it. Inhale at the top, breathe slowly for the 4 seconds down."

*Coaching cue:* "Slow eccentric reveals where the muscle actually is. If the weight is falling rather than lowering, your lat just clocked out early."

**B. 🪡 Half-Kneeling Cable Row (tempo)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 5/side (1-4 tempo — pull is deliberate, return is 4 full seconds)
- Set 2: ⛽ 72% × 5/side (stay tall in the half-kneeling position — no lean back at pull peak)
- Set 3: ⛽ 72% × 4/side (the kneeling position removes momentum options — own the descent)

*Coaching cue:* "The half-kneeling hip is a stability demand. Breathe into the hip — don't clench it."

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

⚪🔨🪡🧩 (Supplemental | Slow-Tempo Accessory | Mindful Bias | Cable/Dumbbell)

Rest: 2 min. Everything at 4-second eccentric.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Face Pull (slow)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 60% × 6/side — 1 sec pull, 2 sec hold at contracted position, 4 sec return
- Set 2: ⛽ 62% × 6/side — the slow return stretches the posterior deltoid under load
- Set 3: ⛽ 62% × 5/side — by the end of the 4 sec return, you should feel the full stretch

*Breathing cue:* "Exhale during the pull. Breathe slowly through the 4-second return."

*Coaching cue:* "The 2-second hold at the top is where the rear delt actually contracts fully. Don't skip it."

**B. 🪡 Alternating Hammer Curl (slow tempo)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 60% × 5/side — 1 sec up, 4 sec down (neutral grip held through the full descent)
- Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 5/side — brachialis is worked most at slow eccentric — feel the forearm load
- Set 3: ⛽ 62% × 4/side — elbow pinned to side throughout

*Coaching cue:* "The slow descent of a hammer curl builds the forearm and elbow thickness that fast curls skip entirely."

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

⚪🔨🪡🪫 (Release | Parasympathetic Downregulation | Slow + Breath)

This block takes the nervous system back to baseline. No pace. No counting.

├─ Dead Hang × 3 × 30 sec (breathe 4 sec in, 6 sec out — no holding breath)
│   (let the lats and teres fully decompress)
├─ Hanging Lat Stretch × 90 sec/side (lean away — full lat length)
│   (breathe continuously — no breath-holding, no forcing)
├─ Kneeling Lat Stretch × 60 sec/side (on the floor — reach overhead, sit back into hips)
│   (exhale into the stretch — let the ribcage drop)
└─ Supine Spinal Twist × 60 sec/side (floor — breathe into the rotation)
   (no forcing — let gravity do the work over 60 seconds)

*Final breath work:* 5 × box breath (4 in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold) before leaving this block.

## 🧮 SAVE

The eccentric is the half of every rep that most sessions rush through. What was slow here becomes the controlled descent in every future row, pull, and hinge.
