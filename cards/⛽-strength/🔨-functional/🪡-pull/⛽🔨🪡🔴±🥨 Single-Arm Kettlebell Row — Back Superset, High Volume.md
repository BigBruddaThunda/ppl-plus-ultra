# 🪡 Single-Arm Kettlebell Row — Back Superset, High Volume 🪡

High-volume unilateral strength pulling | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | 70–80 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🪡🔴

> "More volume, same standards. The reps accumulate — the form doesn't negotiate."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🔴🔨🪡♨️ (Warm-Up | High-Intensity Prep | Functional Bias | Dumbbell/Band)

Rest: Continuous movement — 10 min.

├─ 3 × 10 Band Pull-Apart (explosive separation — fast out, controlled return)
├─ 2 × 8 Scapular Pull-Up (bar — activate scapular depressors before heavy rows)
├─ 2 × 8/side Half-Kneeling Cable Row (light to moderate — prime the elbow path)
│   (3 sets only — you're not training here yet)
└─ 2 × 5/side Single-Arm Kettlebell Swing (moderate — hip hinge activation before Kroc rows)
   (hinge hard, not squat — hamstrings should load)

---

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🔴🔨🪡▶️ (Primer | Neural Potentiation | Unilateral Bias | Dumbbell)

Rest: 2 min between sets.

🥨 tendo — push the ramp steep. You're warming up into the work, not easing into the session.

**A. 🪡 Single-Arm Dumbbell Row (ramp)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 5/side (position: set it, then pull)
- Set 2: ⛽ 72% × 5/side (same path — faster off the bottom)
- Set 3: ⛽ 78% × 4/side (this is the last warmup set — feel the lat contract, not just the arm pull)

*Coaching cue:* "Fast off the bottom, controlled at the top. The eccentric is never casual."

---

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Single-Arm Kettlebell Row**
🔴🔨🪡🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary Strength Pull | High Volume | Dumbbell/Cable)

Rest: 3–4 min between main sets. High volume — do not compress rest here.

**A. 🪡 Kroc Row — Volume Block**

High-load, controlled aggression. More volume than the structured or technical variants.

- Set 1: ⛽ 78% × 6/side (breathe in before every rep — full lat stretch at bottom)
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 6/side (no bounce — each rep starts from a dead position)
- Set 3: ⛽ 82% × 5/side (if both sides match on quality — increase next time)
- Set 4: ⛽ 82% × 5/side (same load — accumulate, not escalate)
- Set 5: ⛽ 80% × 5/side (back-off set — same reps, slightly lighter — feel the lat take over when you're not fighting the weight)

*Coaching cue:* "Kroc Row allows some body English. That's not permission to swing — it's permission to generate real force. The lat still drives the movement."

**B. 🪡 Meadows Row — Volume Block**

- Set 1: ⛽ 78% × 5/side
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 5/side
- Set 3: ⛽ 82% × 4/side (stop if form breaks — you've already accumulated volume in A)

*Coaching cue:* "Different angle from Kroc. Both should fatigue the same part of the lat — if they don't, one of them has wrong mechanics."

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🔴🔨🪡🧩 (Supplemental | Superset Accessory | Reduced Rest | Cable/Dumbbell)

Rest: 90 sec between supersets. Supersets are authorized in 🔴 — pair exercises that don't compete for the same tissue.

🥨 tendo — extend into the rear chain and the bicep. The pull has more rooms.

**Superset A — Rear Delt + Bicep**

Pair: 🪡 Single-Arm Face Pull + 🪡 Alternating Hammer Curl

- Round 1: Face Pull 6/side + Hammer Curl 5/side — rest 90 sec
- Round 2: Face Pull 6/side + Hammer Curl 5/side — rest 90 sec
- Round 3: Face Pull 5/side + Hammer Curl 5/side — rest 90 sec

*Face Pull cue:* "Thumb to ear. Elbow must be at or above shoulder."
*Hammer Curl cue:* "Neutral grip stays neutral. No wrist break at the top."

**Superset B — Lat + Trap**

Pair: 🪡 Single-Arm Lat Pulldown + 🪡 Dumbbell Shrug (hold at top for 2 sec)

- Round 1: Lat Pulldown 6/side + Shrug 8 reps — rest 90 sec
- Round 2: Lat Pulldown 5/side + Shrug 8 reps — rest 90 sec

*Lat Pulldown cue:* "Full reach at the top before every rep. Don't let the lat lose the stretch."
*Shrug cue:* "Hold the top — don't bounce. The trap needs time."

## 5. 🌋 GUTTER

🔴🔨🪡🌋 (Gutter | All-Out Effort | Max Accumulation | Bodyweight/Dumbbell)

Rest: Full — but this block has only one movement and you go until technical failure.

This is not additional volume. This is the final draw on CNS and muscle endurance.

**🪡 Gorilla Row — Max Quality Set**

Load to a weight you can control for 6 reps per side. Go alternating until form breaks.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × AMQR (As Many Quality Reps per side — stop when form degrades, not when it fails)

*Coaching cue:* "When the hip starts to rotate to compensate, the set is over. You're logging the last rep where everything held."

*Log it:* ________ reps/side at ________ load.

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE

🔴🔨🪡🪫 (Release | Cathartic Discharge | High-Intensity Context)

After intense work, this block discharges — not cools down.

├─ Dead Hang × 2 × 45 sec (shake out the hands — let the spine decompress)
├─ Rope Climb × 1 ascent (if available — slow, arm over arm, controlled descent)
│   (if no rope: 2 × 8 Towel Pull-Up — grip and forearm flush)
├─ Hanging Lat Stretch × 90 sec/side (lean away hard — exhale into it)
└─ 2 × 10 Cat-Cow (slow — reset the thoracic spine)

## 🧮 SAVE

Volume without form is just fatigue. The log is not counting reps — it's counting quality reps. The Gutter number is the honest one.
