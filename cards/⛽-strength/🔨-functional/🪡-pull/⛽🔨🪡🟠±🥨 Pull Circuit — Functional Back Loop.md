# 🪡 Pull Circuit — Functional Back Loop 🪡

Station-based unilateral pull circuit | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | 45–55 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🪡🟠

> "Every station recovers a different tissue. The loop keeps everything working."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🟠🔨🪡♨️ (Warm-Up | Circuit Prep | Functional Bias | Bodyweight/Band)

Rest: Continuous — 8 min.

├─ 2 × 10 Band Pull-Apart (horizontal — activate mid-trap)
├─ 2 × 8 Inverted Row (moderate angle — establish the horizontal pull pattern)
├─ 2 × 8 Scapular Pull-Up (bar — pure scap work)
└─ 2 × 5/side Half-Kneeling Cable Row (light — map the elbow path)
   (this is the path you'll be riding hard in a few minutes)

## 2. 🎱 ARAM

🟠🔨🪡🎱 (ARAM | Back Loop | Tissue Rotation | Dumbbell/Cable/Bodyweight)

Loop logic: Every station changes which tissue is working. No two adjacent stations target the same muscle group. The loop recovers each tissue while the others work.

**Circuit structure:** 4 stations. 45 sec on, 15 sec transition. Complete 4 rounds total.

Rest between rounds: 90 sec — full standing recovery.

🥨 tendo — extend into every rep. Pull is not a passive movement.

**Station 1 — 🪡 Single-Arm Lat Pulldown (Cable)**
Target: Lats (vertical plane)
Load: Tier 3 cable — moderate-to-heavy for 45 sec
- Alternate sides each rep (right pull, left pull, right pull...)
- Full reach overhead before every rep
- Elbow drives to hip — not to shoulder

*Coaching cue:* "Think of the cable as the bar. You're pulling yourself up to it, not pulling it down to you."

---

**Station 2 — 🪡 Single-Arm Face Pull (Cable)**
Target: Rear deltoid, mid-trap (horizontal plane)
Load: Lighter cable — control > load
- Same-side reps for 20 sec, then switch
- Elbow at or above shoulder height throughout
- Pull to forehead, not chin

*Coaching cue:* "The rear delt is resting from Station 1. Now it works. That's the loop."

---

**Station 3 — 🪡 Single-Arm Kettlebell Swing**
Target: Erectors, hamstrings, glutes (hip hinge pattern)
Load: Moderate kettlebell — hinge mechanics must hold for 45 sec
- 10 sec/side continuous, alternating every 10 sec
- Hip hinge: hamstrings load, not the back
- Snap the hip, not the lower back

*Coaching cue:* "The bell floats at the top — you don't pull it there. The hip snap drives it."

*Note:* No barbell in 🟠 — kettlebell swing is the hinge option at Tier 2.

---

**Station 4 — 🪡 Alternating Hammer Curl (Standing Dumbbell)**
Target: Biceps, brachialis (elbow flexion)
Load: Moderate dumbbell — 4–6 hard reps per side in 45 sec
- Neutral grip — no wrist supination
- Elbow pinned — if it drifts forward, too heavy
- Hold for 1 second at peak contraction

*Coaching cue:* "The curl recovers the elbow flexors while the hip hinge station was loading the posterior chain. Same arm, different muscle."

## 3. 🪫 RELEASE

🟠🔨🪡🪫 (Release | Post-Circuit Discharge | Full Posterior Chain)

Rest: Move slow — 6 min.

├─ Dead Hang × 2 × 30 sec (shake out the hands — lat decompression)
├─ Hanging Lat Stretch × 60 sec/side (lean away from the bar — breathe)
├─ 10 slow Cat-Cow (match exhale to cat, inhale to cow)
└─ Band Pull-Apart × 2 × 10 slow (restore the mid-trap to resting length)
   (reverse the compression of the circuit)

- ⛽🔨🍗🟠 — legs circuit: continue the tissue-rotation loop format
- 🖼🌹➖🟠 — recovery: posterior chain discharge after the loop work

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 🧮 SAVE

The circuit format taxes the posterior chain through density, not through heavier loading. The loop is the mechanism — each station gets a real rest because something else is working. That's not a shortcut; it's the design.
