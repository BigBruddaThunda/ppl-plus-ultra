# ➖ The Engine Loop — Conditioning Circuit ➖

Conditioning circuit | Cardiovascular system | 45–55 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➖🟠

> "Every station recovers what the last station worked — the loop keeps the engine running without stalling."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🥨 tendo — open each energy system before the loop begins

🟠🔨➖🟠 (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular | Functional | Circuit)

├─ 3 min easy Row on Rowing Machine (Steady State)
│   (stroke by stroke, no pressure, just movement)
├─ 2 min easy Assault Bike (Steady State)
│   (legs loose, find the rhythm)
├─ 2 min Jump Rope (Steady State)
│   (light feet, relaxed wrists)
└─ Dynamic prep:
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) each side
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Lateral/Side-to-Side) each side
   └─ 10 Arm Circles (Forward) + 10 Arm Circles (Backward)

Rest: None. The warm-up is the transition practice.

**Preview the loop:** Walk each station. Know where you are going before the clock starts. The transitions are not recovery — they are part of the work.

## 2. 🎱 ARAM
🥨 tendo — push the loop through full rotations

🟠🔨➖🟠 (ARAM | Cardiovascular | Functional | Circuit)

**Loop Logic:** Each station alternates which energy system and tissue is primary. No two adjacent stations demand the same dominant action.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STATION A  →  STATION B  →  STATION C  →  STATION D  →  ↩  │
│  Rowing         Assault       Ski Erg       Sled Push        │
│  (upper pull,   Bike          (upper pull,  (lower push,     │
│  posterior)     (legs/total)  horizontal)   hip drive)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**STATION A: ➖ Rowing Machine (Steady State) → hard interval**
├─ Work: 45 sec at ⛽ hard effort (24–26 spm, controlled aggression)
│   (push the drive, don't rush the recovery)
└─ Transition: 15 sec walk to Station B

**STATION B: ➖ Assault Bike (Steady State) → hard interval**
├─ Work: 45 sec at ⛽ hard effort (arms + legs, max sustainable RPM)
│   (arms and legs together — don't let one coast)
└─ Transition: 15 sec walk to Station C

**STATION C: ➖ Ski Erg (Steady State) → hard interval**
├─ Work: 45 sec at ⛽ hard effort (drive hips back first, then pull)
│   (hips lead the movement, arms follow)
└─ Transition: 15 sec walk to Station D

**STATION D: ➖ Sled Push (Light/Fast) — explosive drive**
├─ Work: 20m hard push at ⛽ effort (lean forward, fast feet)
│   (drive through the footstrike, not through the arms)
└─ Transition: walk sled back to start (active recovery) → return to Station A

**Loop structure:**
- 4 loops through all 4 stations = 1 round
- Rest: 3 min full rest between rounds
- Total rounds: 3

**Loop tissue rotation check:**
- Station A: Posterior chain pull (rowing drive) + cardiovascular
- Station B: Bilateral push/pull (bike) — total body, legs dominant
- Station C: Upper bilateral pull (ski erg) — different plane than rowing
- Station D: Lower push, hip extension, ground-based (sled)
Each station recovers what the previous demanded. Loop logic confirmed.

**If Ski Erg is unavailable — substitute Station C:**
Station C alternate: ➖ Battle Ropes (Intervals) × 30 sec hard effort
(alternating wave, drive from shoulders, hips loaded)
Transition: 15 sec walk to Station D

**If Sled is unavailable — substitute Station D:**
Station D alternate: ➖ Sprint (30–60 meters) × hard effort
Walk back recovery → return to Station A

## 3. 🪫 RELEASE
Effort out — full system wind-down.

🟠 context: 3 rounds of loop work generates significant metabolic stress — the release is earned and necessary.

├─ 5 min easy Rowing Machine (Steady State)
│   (damper 3, 18 spm, let the heart rate fall)
├─ 5 min easy walk
│   (shoulders down, breathe through nose)
└─ 60 sec diaphragmatic breathing
   (slow exhale, longer than the inhale)

## 🧮 SAVE

A circuit that puts two upper-pull stations adjacent is not a circuit — it is a superset with a walk. Loop logic means every station is recovering something while working something else. When the loop is right, you can sustain more total output across all rounds.
