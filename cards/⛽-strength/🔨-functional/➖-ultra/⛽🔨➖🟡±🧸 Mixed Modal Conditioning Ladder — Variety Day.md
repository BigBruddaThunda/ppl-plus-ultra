# ➖ Mixed Modal Conditioning Ladder — Variety Day ➖

Mixed modality conditioning | Cardiovascular system | 50–65 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➖🟡

> "The engine is the same — the fuel source you put it through tells you something new each time."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🧸 fero — carry the body across a brief tour of today's modalities

🟡🔨➖🟡 (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular | Functional | Fun)

A short preview of everything that shows up later:

├─ 2 min easy Rowing Machine (Steady State) (18 spm, long strokes)
├─ 2 min easy Jump Rope (Steady State) (find a comfortable rhythm)
├─ 2 min easy Assault Bike (Steady State) (legs and arms loose)
└─ Dynamic prep:
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) each side
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Lateral/Side-to-Side) each side
   └─ 10 Arm Circles (Forward) + 10 Arm Circles (Backward)

Rest: None. This is also the modality orientation.

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — prime the system across two contrasting modalities

🟡🔨➖🟡 (Primer | Cardiovascular | Functional | Fun)

**Modality 1: Rowing Intervals (500m)**
├─ Piece 1: 500m at 70% effort — (warm up the pattern)
└─ Rest: 3 min

**Modality 2: Sprint (60–100 meters)**
├─ Sprint 1: 60m at 75% effort — (open the stride)
└─ Rest: 2 min walk-back

Both modalities are now primed. The main work will use them differently.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

Primary Pattern: **Skater Hops**
🧸 fero — carry hard effort through the modality shuffle

🟡🔨➖🟡 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular | Functional | Fun)

**The Shuffle Format:** Each round, a different primary modality. The effort standard stays constant (⛽ hard, full rest). The movement changes.

Rest: 4 min full rest between every round.

**Round 1: ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m)**
- ⛽ hard effort × 500m — (feel the pull, find the split)
- Log split time

**Round 2: ➖ Sprint (60–100 meters) × 4 repeats**
- ⛽ 80% × 80m per sprint — (same effort zone, different movement)
- Rest 90 sec between sprints (active walk-back)
- Log if timed

**Round 3: ➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1)**
- ⛽ hard effort × 60 sec — note calories or RPM
- Rest 60 sec complete
- Repeat × 2 sets within this round
- Rest 4 min after round

**Round 4: ➖ Ski Erg Intervals (500m)**
- ⛽ hard effort × 500m — (hips first, arms follow)
- Log split time
- If no Ski Erg: repeat Rowing Intervals (500m) or use Battle Ropes (Intervals) × 45 sec hard

**Round 5: ➖ Rowing Intervals (1000m)**
- ⛽ sustained hard effort × 1000m — (the longest piece, manage the pace)
- (first 500m at Round 1 split pace, second 500m hold or push)
- Log time

**What you are learning:** Your effort sense should feel consistent across all five rounds even though the modality changed each time. If the bike rounds felt harder or easier than the rowing rounds at the same effort level, that tells you something about where your conditioning is asymmetric.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🏖 SANDBOX
🧸 fero — carry the conditioning into an unstructured modality choice

🟡🔨➖🟡 (Sandbox | Cardiovascular | Functional | Fun)

**Choose one. Execute it for 2 rounds.**

Options (all from Section M — Cardio & Conditioning):
- ➖ Fartlek Run (Speed Play) × 8 min — free variation of pace, no prescribed intervals
  (alternate between jog, tempo, sprint at will — stay in the hard zone overall)
- ➖ Double-Unders × 4 × 45 sec hard effort, 45 sec rest
  (if you can double-under — the ceiling is real)
- ➖ Battle Ropes (Intervals) × 4 × 30 sec max wave, 60 sec rest
  (alternating wave, rotational wave, or slam — your choice per set)
- ➖ Track Intervals (200m/400m/800m) — pick your distance, run 3 rounds at hard effort
  (400m is the most honest at ⛽ effort)

No prescription beyond: stay in the ⛽ effort zone. Rest fully between rounds. Log what you chose and how it felt relative to the main work.

Rest: 3 min between sandbox rounds. 3 min before cool-down.

## 🧮 SAVE

Conditioning across multiple modalities in one session is diagnostic — you learn where the engine is strong and where it leaks. Log the asymmetry, not just the effort. That asymmetry is next week's focus.
