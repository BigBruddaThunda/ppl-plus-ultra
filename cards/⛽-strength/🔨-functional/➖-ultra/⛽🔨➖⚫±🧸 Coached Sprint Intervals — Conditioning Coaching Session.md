# ➖ Coached Sprint Intervals — Conditioning Coaching Session ➖

Hard interval education | Cardiovascular system | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➖⚫

> "Learn what hard actually feels like before you try to go harder."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🧸 fero — bring the body online gradually

⚫🔨➖⚫ (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular | Functional | Teaching)

├─ 5 min easy Row on Rowing Machine (Steady State)
│   (loose grip, let legs drive)
├─ 2 min Jump Rope (Steady State)
│   (find rhythm, breathe through nose)
└─ Dynamic movement prep:
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) each side
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Lateral/Side-to-Side) each side
   └─ 10 Arm Circles (Forward) + 10 Arm Circles (Backward)

Rest: None. Continuous movement.

**Teaching note:** The warm-up is information. Notice where you hold tension. Notice your natural breathing rate. This is your baseline — the thing intervals will test.

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — calibrate your effort sense

⚫🔨➖⚫ (Primer | Cardiovascular | Functional | Teaching)

Three build efforts on Rowing Machine (Steady State) → Rowing Intervals (500m) pace:

├─ Build 1: 90 sec at easy effort (conversational, nose-breathing)
│   (this is Zone 2 — remember this feeling)
├─ Build 2: 90 sec at moderate effort (mouth breathing, sustainable)
│   (this is Zone 3 — sustainable but not comfortable)
└─ Build 3: 60 sec at hard effort (controlled aggression, push pace)
   (this is Zone 4 — this is where today's work lives)

Rest: 3 min full rest between builds.

**Teaching note:** Each build is a zone landmark. Zone 4 — the last build — is your target for the main intervals. Not sprinting, not comfortable. Controlled and hard.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🛠 CRAFT
🧸 fero — build the mechanical skill of pacing

⚫🔨➖⚫ (Craft | Cardiovascular | Functional | Teaching)

**Rowing Machine Technique Walk-Through:**

├─ Segment 1: Legs only (arms extended, back straight)
│   3 × 10 strokes at 18 spm (slow, deliberate)
│   (heels down, push the footboard away)
│
├─ Segment 2: Legs + Back (add the hinge at the finish)
│   3 × 10 strokes at 18 spm
│   (hinge back before arms break)
│
└─ Segment 3: Full stroke (add the arm pull through)
   3 × 10 strokes at 20 spm
   (sequence: legs → back → arms. always in that order)

Rest: 90 sec between segments.

**Teaching note:** Rowing Intervals (500m) pace collapses if the stroke sequence breaks down under fatigue. The legs drive power. The arms finish. Reversing that costs you 5–8 sec per 500m and blows out the lower back. Fix it here, not mid-interval.

**Pacing education — what 75–85% effort looks like on the erg:**
- Split pace should be 8–12 sec per 500m slower than your all-out 500m pace
- Stroke rate: 24–26 spm for hard intervals (not 32 — that's sprinting)
- If you can speak in short sentences, you are not at 80%
- If you cannot complete a stroke sequence, you went too hard

## 4. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Sprint Intervals**
Primary Pattern: **Sprint Intervals**
🧸 fero — carry sustained hard effort across rounds

⚫🔨➖⚫ (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular | Functional | Teaching)

**➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) — 4 rounds**

Rest: 4 min full rest between rounds (⛽ Strength parameters — full recovery mandatory).

- Round 1: ⛽ 75% effort × 500m — (establish baseline, don't chase)
- Round 2: ⛽ 78% effort × 500m — (add 1–2 sec/500m faster than Round 1)
- Round 3: ⛽ 80% effort × 500m — (hold mechanics, push pace slightly)
- Round 4: ⛽ 80% effort × 500m — (match Round 3 within 3 seconds)

Log splits. All 4 rounds should be within 5 seconds of each other.

**Teaching note:** The goal is NOT the fastest round — it is the flattest distribution. A 5-second spread across 4 rounds at hard effort is excellent pacing. A 15-second drop-off from Round 1 to Round 4 means you went out too hard. Intervals teach restraint as much as they teach effort.

**Teaching note — rest:** 4 minutes feels like a long time. Use it. The purpose of full rest in ⛽ Strength conditioning is complete-ish recovery so the next interval can be executed at the same quality. Cutting rest short collapses Round 3 and 4. Do not cut rest short.

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🧸 fero — carry the conditioning stimulus into a secondary modality

⚫🔨➖⚫ (Supplemental | Cardiovascular | Functional | Teaching)

**➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) — 3 rounds**

Rest: 3 min between rounds.

- Round 1: ⛽ 60 sec at hard effort — (different machine, same effort sense)
- Round 2: ⛽ 60 sec at hard effort — (notice which muscle groups fade first)
- Round 3: ⛽ 60 sec at hard effort — (hold the pedal rate steady)

**Teaching note:** Moving from rowing to Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) teaches you that the effort zone is transferable across modalities. The sensation of 80% on the erg is the same sensation on the bike — different muscles, same internal signal. This is the transfer skill.

Rest after final round: 3 min before cool-down.

                    (somatic recovery — let the engine cool fully before next session)

- ⛽🔨🍗⚫ — leg strength while cardiovascular base settles

## 🧮 SAVE

The split data is more informative than how hard it felt. Consistent pacing under hard effort is a skill that develops over weeks, not sessions. Log the spread, not just the fastest number.
