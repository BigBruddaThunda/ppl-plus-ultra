# ➖ Shuttle Run and Crawl Intervals — Conditioning, No Equipment ➖

Bodyweight intervals | Cardiovascular system | 45–55 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➖🟢

> "The gym is not the only place hard effort happens."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🧸 fero — bring the engine online without equipment

🟢🔨➖🟢 (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular | Functional | Bodyweight)

├─ 3 min easy jog or Walking (Zone 2 Heart Rate)
│   (nose breathing, loose arms)
├─ Dynamic mobility sequence:
│   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) each side
│   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Lateral/Side-to-Side) each side
│   ├─ 10 Walking High Knees (deliberate, hip fully up)
│   └─ 8 Arm Circles (Forward) + 8 Arm Circles (Backward)
└─ 2 min easy jog
   (now you're warm)

Rest: None. Continuous.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — open the throttle before the main work

🟢🔨➖🟢 (Primer | Cardiovascular | Functional | Bodyweight)

Three Sprint (30–60 meters) build efforts on flat ground:

├─ Build 1: 30m at 70% effort — (long stride, stay upright)
├─ Build 2: 40m at 80% effort — (drive the arms, heels off ground)
└─ Build 3: 50m at 90% effort — (max controllable speed, not panicked)

Rest: 2 min walk-back recovery between builds.

These are not timed. They establish sprint mechanics before the intervals ask for effort.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

Primary Pattern: **Shuttle Run**
🧸 fero — carry hard effort across repeated sprints

🟢🔨➖🟢 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular | Functional | Bodyweight)

**➖ Sprint (60–100 meters) Repeats — 5 rounds**

Rest: 4 min full walk-back recovery between rounds (⛽ Strength parameters).

- Round 1: ⛽ 75% effort × 80m — (find the pace, don't chase the clock)
- Round 2: ⛽ 80% effort × 80m — (push slightly, mechanics hold)
- Round 3: ⛽ 80% effort × 80m — (match Round 2)
- Round 4: ⛽ 80% effort × 80m — (still matching, not dying)
- Round 5: ⛽ 78% effort × 80m — (controlled finish, stride clean)

Log time if possible. All 5 rounds should be within 1.5 seconds of each other.

**What 80% looks like on a sprint:** stride length is full but not lurching. Ground contact is brief. Arms drive hard. You could repeat this 2 more times if needed — but you wouldn't want to.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🧸 fero — transfer sprint effort into a sustained output modality

🟢🔨➖🟢 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular | Functional | Bodyweight)

**A. ➖ Jump Rope Intervals (1 minute on/off) — 4 rounds**

Rest: 3 min between rounds.

- Round 1: ⛽ 60 sec continuous Jump Rope (Steady State) at moderate pace
  (establish rhythm, don't trip)
- Round 2: ⛽ 60 sec at hard effort — (push tempo, stay controlled)
- Round 3: ⛽ 60 sec at hard effort — (hold this pace)
- Round 4: ⛽ 60 sec at hard effort — (finish clean)

If no jump rope is available:
**B. ➖ High Knees (Explosive) — 4 rounds × 45 sec**
├─ Drive knees above hip height
├─ Arms pump in sync with legs
└─ Land light, push off hard

Rest: 3 min between rounds.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE
Effort out — let the system settle.

├─ 5 min easy walk or jog (nose breathing, shoulders relaxed)
├─ 30 sec Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) each side
├─ 30 sec Leg Swings (Lateral/Side-to-Side) each side
└─ 5 deep breaths: inhale 4 sec, hold 2, exhale 6

Rest: This is the rest.

## 6. 🚂 JUNCTION

Cross-Junction map:

```text
               ↑ ⛽🔨➕🟢
                    (power — carry sprint base into full-body bodyweight power work)

← ⛽🔨🍗🟢   •   ⛽🔨➖🟢   → ⛽🔨🛒🟢
  (legs: sprint transfers directly to lunge/squat patterns)      (push: upper body, still no equipment)

               ↓ 🖼🌹➖🟢
                    (somatic recovery — bodyweight restore, no gym still required)
```

```

- ⛽🔨➖🔵 — take this effort into structured interval tracking with equipment
- ⛽🔨🍗🟢 — legs: sprint conditioning translates directly into leg work
- ⛽🔨➕🟢 — carry the sprint base into full-body power patterns

## 🧮 SAVE

Sprint conditioning without a gym is still sprint conditioning. The body does not know what building you are in. Log the spread — consistency across rounds is the signal that the engine is developing.
