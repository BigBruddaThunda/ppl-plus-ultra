# ➖ Precision at Output — Technical Interval Work ➖

Technical hard intervals | Cardiovascular system | 50–65 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➖🟣

> "Fewer rounds, full rest, perfect execution — the quality standard applied to conditioning."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🥨 tendo — extend range before demanding technical output

🟣🔨➖🟣 (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular | Functional | Technical)

├─ 8 min progressive Rowing Machine (Steady State)
│   ├─ Min 1–3: Easy pace, 18 spm, focus on stroke sequence
│   │   (legs → back → arms, every stroke deliberate)
│   ├─ Min 4–6: Moderate pace, 20 spm, add power
│   │   (feel the catch pressure before pulling)
│   └─ Min 7–8: Approach working pace, 22 spm
│       (this should feel like a preview of the main intervals)
└─ Technique audit (2 min, rowing stopped):
   ├─ Check damper setting — 4 or 5 for intervals (not 7–10)
   ├─ Confirm foot strap — snug, not cutting circulation
   └─ Set monitor to display split (2:XX/500m) and stroke rate

Rest: None during warm-up. 2 min rest before Primer.

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🥨 tendo — calibrate split pace with technical precision

🟣🔨➖🟣 (Primer | Cardiovascular | Functional | Technical)

Two calibration pieces on Rowing Intervals (500m):

├─ Piece 1: 500m at 78% effort — time it exactly
│   (record split, record stroke rate)
│   (this sets your A-interval target)
│   Rest: 5 min complete rest
│
└─ Piece 2: 500m at 82% effort — time it exactly
   (record split, record stroke rate)
   (this sets your ceiling — do not exceed this in the main work)
   Rest: 5 min complete rest before main work

**Technical standard for these primers:**
- Catch: shins vertical at the catch, no layback before the drive
- Drive: heels stay down until knees pass 90 degrees
- Finish: handle pulls to lower sternum, body angle 11 o'clock
- Recovery: arms extend first, then hinge forward, then slide forward

Any technical breakdown → note it. You will address it in the main intervals.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
🥨 tendo — push limits within technical standards

🟣🔨➖🟣 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular | Functional | Technical)

**➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) — 4 rounds at technical standard**

Rest: 5 min full rest between rounds (🟣 Technical — extended rest for quality preservation).

- Round 1: ⛽ A-interval target split × 500m — (execute the primer pace)
  (technical focus: catch position clean, no slipping forward)
- Round 2: ⛽ match Round 1 ±2 sec × 500m — (tighten the standard)
  (technical focus: drive sequence clean through fatigue)
- Round 3: ⛽ match Round 2 ±2 sec × 500m — (this is where technique earns its keep)
  (technical focus: finish position — handle to lower sternum, every stroke)
- Round 4: ⛽ match Round 3 ±3 sec × 500m — (complete the block)
  (technical focus: recovery — do not rush the slide, earn the next catch)

Log each split AND stroke rate. Both matter.

**Quality standard:** If technique collapses in any round (catch arm pull, early hinge, heels lifting), that round does not count as a technical success regardless of split time. Technique and output together — that is 🟣 Technical.

**➖ Ski Erg Intervals (500m) — 2 rounds (if available)**

Rest: 5 min between rounds.

- Round 1: ⛽ hard effort × 500m — (ski erg demands bilateral pull, different pattern than row)
  (hips drive back before arms pull down)
- Round 2: ⛽ match Round 1 ±3 sec × 500m

Rest: 5 min before supplemental.

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🥨 tendo — extend technical demand into sled work

🟣🔨➖🟣 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular | Functional | Technical)

**➖ Sled Push (Heavy) — 3 rounds × 20m**

Rest: 4 min full rest between rounds.

- Round 1: ⛽ heavy load × 20m — (drive from hips, not lower back)
  (lean angle 45 degrees, step-over footwork)
- Round 2: ⛽ same load × 20m — (maintain lean, don't let hips rise)
- Round 3: ⛽ same load × 20m — (finish with same mechanics as Round 1)

**Technical standard:** Load is secondary to pattern. The sled should feel like it is being driven — not dragged. Power comes from hip extension, not lumbar extension.

If no sled is available: 3 rounds × 60 sec Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) at hard effort. Rest 4 min between rounds.

## 🧮 SAVE

A split with broken technique is not the same data point as a split with clean technique. Log both the time and the technical quality. Over weeks, both numbers should improve together — if the split improves while technique collapses, you have only gotten better at compensating.
