# ➖ Maximum Engine — Intense Conditioning ➖

Max-effort intervals | Cardiovascular system | 55–70 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➖🔴

> "Maximum output is not about going until you break — it is about sustaining the highest output you can repeat."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🥨 tendo — extend readiness to full operational range

🔴🔨➖🔴 (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular | Functional | Intense)

├─ 4 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) easy pace
│   (20 spm, damper 4–5, flush out stiffness)
├─ 4 min Assault Bike (Steady State) easy rpm
│   (legs loose, shoulders relaxed)
└─ Dynamic prep:
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) each side
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Lateral/Side-to-Side) each side
   ├─ 10 Arm Circles (Forward) + 10 Arm Circles (Backward)
   └─ 2 min Jump Rope (Steady State) easy rhythm

Rest: None. Continuous.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🥨 tendo — drive the system to near-maximal before the main work

🔴🔨➖🔴 (Primer | Cardiovascular | Functional | Intense)

Three progressive build pieces on Rowing Intervals (500m) pace:

├─ Build 1: 90 sec at 80% — (establish hard pace)
│   Rest: 2 min
├─ Build 2: 60 sec at 88% — (push toward ceiling)
│   Rest: 2 min
└─ Build 3: 30 sec at 95% — (near-sprint, controlled aggression)
   Rest: 3 min full rest before main work

The system should be firing by Build 3. If not, add one more 30-sec build at 90% and take 3 min rest.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
🥨 tendo — push limits across the full interval block

🔴🔨➖🔴 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular | Functional | Intense)

**A. ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) — 5 rounds at maximum repeatable effort**

Rest: 3 min between rounds (🔴 Intense — slightly compressed from full ⛽ standard).

- Round 1: ⛽ 85% effort × 500m — (this sets the ceiling for the block)
- Round 2: ⛽ 85% effort × 500m — (hold exactly)
- Round 3: ⛽ 83% effort × 500m — (controlled, don't blow up)
- Round 4: ⛽ 83% effort × 500m — (still competing with the split)
- Round 5: ⛽ max effort × 500m — (everything left, every stroke)

Log splits. Last round should be ≤3 sec slower than fastest round.

**B. ➖ Sled Sprint (Resisted) — 4 rounds × 20m**

Rest: 3 min between rounds.

- Round 1: ⛽ moderate load × 20m — (fast, aggressive, drive from hips)
- Round 2: ⛽ same load × 20m — (match or beat Round 1 time)
- Round 3: ⛽ same load × 20m — (push pace)
- Round 4: ⛽ same load × 20m — (everything)

Rest 5 min after Sled block before Supplemental.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🥨 tendo — extend the engine with a secondary modality at compressed rest

🔴🔨➖🔴 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular | Functional | Intense)

**➖ Assault Bike Intervals (2:1) — 4 rounds**

Work: 45 sec at max sustainable effort
Rest: 22 sec (compressed for 🔴 Intense)

- Round 1: ⛽ max sustainable effort × 45 sec — note calories
- Round 2: ⛽ match or beat Round 1
- Round 3: ⛽ hold
- Round 4: ⛽ hold

Rest: 4 min full rest after supplemental block.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🌋 GUTTER
🥨 tendo — all-out final test

🔴🔨➖🔴 (Gutter | Cardiovascular | Functional | Intense)

**➖ Rowing Sprints (250m) — max effort, single attempt**

One round. No pacing. No strategy. Everything.

Set 1: ⛽ 100% × 250m — (fastest 250m you can produce today)

Log the time. This is today's max output marker.

**Note:** This is not part of the volume — it is the test that comes after the volume. If you have nothing left after the main work, skip it and note that in the log. The Gutter only has value if you can execute it at full effort.

Rest: 5 min before Release.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE
Stress OUT — discharge the session.

🔴 context: release is active discharge, not passive sitting.

├─ 5 min easy Rowing Machine (Steady State) or Assault Bike (Steady State)
│   (heart rate dropping, breathing normalizing — watch it fall)
├─ 2 min easy Jump Rope (Steady State)
│   (light feet, loose wrists)
└─ 60 sec diaphragmatic breathing
   (hand on belly, slow exhale longer than inhale)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 7. 🚂 JUNCTION

Rowing splits: ___ / ___ / ___ / ___ / ___
Spread: _______ sec | Fastest: _______ | Last round: _______
Sled times (if logged): ___ / ___ / ___ / ___
Assault bike calories: ___ / ___ / ___ / ___
Gutter 250m time: _______ (or: skipped — nothing left)

```

Next →
- ⛽🔨➖🟣 — take the max-effort data and refine it with technical precision
- ⛽🔨➖🔵 — pull back to structured volume to recover and build base
- 🖼🌹➖🔴 — after this session, restoration is likely the correct next move

## 🧮 SAVE

Maximum effort sessions are data collection events. The splits tell you where your ceiling is today. The spread tells you how well you can sustain near-maximal output. Both numbers change over time — log them both.
