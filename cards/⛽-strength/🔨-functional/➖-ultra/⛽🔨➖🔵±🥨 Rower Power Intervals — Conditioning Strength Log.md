# ➖ Rower Power Intervals — Conditioning Strength Log ➖

Structured hard intervals | Cardiovascular system | 50–60 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➖🔵

> "The prescription is the training — follow it exactly, then record what happened."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🥨 tendo — extend range before demanding output

🔵🔨➖🔵 (Warm-Up | Cardiovascular | Functional | Structured)

├─ 5 min Rowing Machine (Steady State) at easy pace (18–20 spm)
│   (damper 4–5, long strokes, breathe steadily)
├─ 5 min Assault Bike (Steady State) at easy rpm
│   (legs doing 70% of work, arms light)
└─ Dynamic prep:
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) each side
   ├─ 10 Leg Swings (Lateral/Side-to-Side) each side
   └─ 10 Arm Circles (Forward) + 10 Arm Circles (Backward)

Rest: None. Continuous.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🥨 tendo — prime the system to exact working pace

🔵🔨➖🔵 (Primer | Cardiovascular | Functional | Structured)

Rowing Intervals (500m) pace builds:

├─ Build 1: 2 min at 70% effort
│   (note the split on the monitor — this is your easy pace)
├─ Build 2: 90 sec at 80% effort
│   (note the split — this is your target interval pace)
└─ Build 3: 60 sec at 85% effort
   (note the split — this is your ceiling, do not exceed in main work)

Rest: 2 min between builds.

**Record all three splits before starting the main work.** They are your calibration numbers for today.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

Primary Pattern: **Rowing Ergometer Sprint**
🥨 tendo — execute the full prescription without deviation

🔵🔨➖🔵 (Bread & Butter | Cardiovascular | Functional | Structured)

**A. ➖ Rowing Intervals (500m) — 5 rounds**

Rest: 4 min full rest between rounds (⛽ Strength parameters).

- Round 1: ⛽ Target split × 500m — (set the benchmark)
- Round 2: ⛽ Target split ±2 sec × 500m — (hold it)
- Round 3: ⛽ Target split ±2 sec × 500m — (still holding)
- Round 4: ⛽ Target split ±2 sec × 500m — (this is where it earns)
- Round 5: ⛽ Target split ±3 sec × 500m — (finish within tolerance)

Log each split. Target spread: ≤5 seconds across all 5 rounds.

**What to record:**
- Split per round (displayed as 2:XX/500m on the monitor)
- Stroke rate per round (target: 24–26 spm)
- Whether you held or collapsed in Round 4–5

**B. ➖ 400m Repeats — 3 rounds (outdoor track or treadmill)**

If rowing is the A block, 400m run is the B block. Both cannot be primary — pick one based on available equipment. If both are available: complete A before B with 8 min full rest between blocks.

Rest: 4 min full rest between rounds.

- Round 1: ⛽ controlled pace × 400m — (not sprinting, powerful stride)
- Round 2: ⛽ match Round 1 ±3 sec — (this is the test)
- Round 3: ⛽ match Round 2 ±3 sec — (complete the prescription)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🥨 tendo — extend the engine stimulus into a second modality

🔵🔨➖🔵 (Supplemental | Cardiovascular | Functional | Structured)

**➖ Assault Bike Intervals (1:1) — 4 rounds**

Work: 60 sec at hard effort
Rest: 60 sec complete rest (off the bike)

- Round 1: ⛽ hard effort × 60 sec — note calories or RPM
- Round 2: ⛽ match or beat Round 1
- Round 3: ⛽ match Round 2
- Round 4: ⛽ match Round 3

Rest: 3 min full rest after final round.

Log total calories or average RPM per round. The bike does not lie.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE
Effort out — structured wind-down.

├─ 5 min easy Assault Bike (Steady State) or walk
│   (RPM drops to conversational level, shoulders drop)
├─ 60 sec diaphragmatic breathing
│   (hand on belly, breathe belly first, then chest)
└─ 30 sec Leg Swings (Forward/Backward) each side

## 🧮 SAVE

A prescription only teaches you something if you track what happened. The split data is the training. The log is what makes the next session smarter than this one.
