# 🍗 Slow Eccentric Split Squat — Quad Stability, 4-Second Descent 🍗

Strength functional session | Quad Stability, 4-Second Descent | 55–75 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🍗⚪

> "The eccentric is the work — every descent is 4 seconds, every rep is a conversation with the tissue."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🧸 fero — deliberate entry, no rushing, breath before load

```
⚪🔨🍗♨️ (Warm-Up | Legs | Functional | Mindful)
```

├─ 5 min walk — unhurried, nasal breathing only
├─ 8 × Leg Swings (Forward/Back) per leg — slow, feel the hip at the end range
├─ 8 × Leg Swings (Side-to-Side) per leg — slow, breathe out at the end of each swing
├─ 8 × Hip CARs per side — full, slow circles — feel the joint, not the speed
├─ 6 × Walking Lunge (Bodyweight) — 3-second descent on each rep
└─ 6 × Single-Leg Hip Hinge per side — pause at the bottom, breathe before returning

Breathing note: Begin establishing nasal breathing in the warm-up. It carries into the working sets.
Rest: Move through at your own pace — there is no hurry here.

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — ramp with 4-second eccentrics from the first working set

```
⚪🔨🍗▶️ (Primer | Legs | Functional | Mindful)
```

**🍗 Weighted Bulgarian Split Squat (Dumbbells) — slow ramp**

├─ Ramp 1: 50% × 4 per side (4-second descent — slow enough to feel the quad load throughout)
├─ Ramp 2: 60% × 3 per side (4-second descent — notice where the weight shifts in the bottom position)
└─ Ramp 3: 70% × 3 per side (4-second descent — breathe in on the way down, out as you drive up)

Rest: 2 min between ramp sets. Not 90 seconds — 2 minutes.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

Primary Pattern: **Split Squat (Slow Eccentric)**
🧸 fero — slow descent as the primary training stimulus

```
⚪🔨🍗🧈 (Bread & Butter | Legs | Functional | Mindful)
```

Rest: 3 min between all sets. Minimum — extend to 4 min if needed.
Eccentric tempo: Every descent is 4 seconds. No exceptions.
Note: Complete all reps on one side before switching.

**A. 🍗 Weighted Bulgarian Split Squat (Dumbbells)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 per side
│   ├─ (4-second descent — count in your head: one, two, three, four)
│   └─ (pause 1 second at the bottom — own the bottom before driving up)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5 per side
│   └─ (breathe in on the way down, out as you drive through the front heel)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 78% × 4 per side
│   └─ (if the 4-second eccentric degrades at any point, the set is done)
└─ Set 4: ⛽ 78% × 4 per side
   └─ (same quality as set 1 — slow is the whole point)

**B. 🍗 Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (Dumbbell)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 per side
│   └─ (4-second hinge to the floor — feel the hamstring loading through the full range)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5 per side
│   └─ (breathe in as you hinge, breathe out as you return — do not hold the breath)
└─ Set 3: ⛽ 78% × 4 per side
   └─ (pause 1 second when the torso is parallel — feel the hamstring tension before the return)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🧸 fero — carry the slow tempo into calves and the lateral plane

```
⚪🔨🍗🧩 (Supplemental | Legs | Functional | Mindful)
```

Rest: 2 min between sets.

**A. 🍗 Weighted Lateral Lunge**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 4 per side (4-second descent into the lateral lunge — feel the adductor stretch)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 70% × 4 per side (pause 1 second in the bottom — breathe before returning)

**B. 🍗 Single-Leg Standing Calf Raise (Weighted)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 6 per side
│   ├─ (4-second descent — heel drops fully, slow controlled lowering)
│   └─ (pause 1 second at the top — do not rush the rep)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 6 per side
   └─ (nasal breathing throughout — the calf raise is not exempt from the breath protocol)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE
🧸 fero — parasympathetic downregulation — tension down, not stress out

├─ 90 sec × Couch Stretch (Hip Flexor Deep) per side — long, passive hold, breathe into the front of the hip
├─ 90 sec × Pigeon Pose (Glute Stretch) per side — let the weight of the body do the work
├─ 60 sec × Lying Quad Stretch (Prone) per side — breathe and soften
├─ 8 × Hip CARs per side — slower than the warm-up, closing the session
└─ 2 min × Deep Squat Hold (Hip Mobility) — feet flat, relax completely, breathe

Breathing note: Slow this whole block down. Extended exhalations (breathe in for 4 seconds, breathe out for 8) activate the parasympathetic system. The release is not a formality — it is half the session.

## 🧮 SAVE

The 4-second eccentric is not a novelty — it is a different kind of stimulus than fast reps at the same load. The tissue adapts to the time under tension. Log whether you held the tempo throughout — that is the metric at this address.
