# 🍗 Pistol Squat Progression — Quad and Glute Strength, No Equipment 🍗

Bodyweight strength | Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🍗🟢

> "If your gym strength doesn't transfer to a single leg on the floor, it hasn't fully landed yet."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🧸 fero — wake the hips, ankles, and stabilizers before loading one leg

```
🟢🔨🍗♨️ (Warm-Up | Legs | Functional | Bodyweight)
```

├─ 5 min easy movement — walk, jog in place, or stair climbing
├─ 10 × Leg Swings (Forward/Back) per leg
├─ 10 × Leg Swings (Side-to-Side) per leg
├─ 8 × Hip CARs per side (slow, full range)
├─ 8 × Walking Lunge (Bodyweight) — keep the torso upright
├─ 6 × Skater Squat per side (bodyweight) — feel the single-leg balance demand
└─ 6 × Single-Leg Hip Hinge per side (slow) — hinge without weight first

Rest: Move through without stopping.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — ramp the CNS toward pistol and Nordic demands

```
🟢🔨🍗▶️ (Primer | Legs | Functional | Bodyweight)
```

**🍗 Assisted Pistol Squat (TRX/Band)**

├─ Set 1: 🟢 Bodyweight × 5 per side (use band or door frame for balance — find the bottom position)
├─ Set 2: 🟢 Bodyweight × 4 per side (reduce assistance — more load into the working leg)
└─ Set 3: 🟢 Bodyweight × 3 per side (minimal assistance if possible — test the balance)

Rest: 90 sec between sets.
Note: The primer is not max effort. It is preparation. Stop before failure.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

Primary Pattern: **Pistol Squat**
🧸 fero — the transfer test: does single-leg strength hold without external load?

```
🟢🔨🍗🧈 (Bread & Butter | Legs | Functional | Bodyweight)
```

Rest: 3–4 min between all sets.
Note: Complete all reps on one side before switching. Bodyweight = your own bodyweight as the resistance.

**A. 🍗 Pistol Squat (Single-Leg)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ Bodyweight × 5 per side (arms extended forward for counterbalance — heel stays planted)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ Bodyweight × 5 per side (control the descent — 3 seconds down, drive up)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ Bodyweight × 4 per side (if form breaks, stop the set and rest — not a conditioning drill)
└─ Set 4: ⛽ Bodyweight × 4 per side (same quality as set 1 or it does not count)

Note: If unassisted pistol is not yet accessible, perform Shrimp Squat (Rear-Foot Single-Leg) as the substitution. Same loading protocol.

**B. 🍗 Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (Bodyweight)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ Bodyweight × 6 per side (reach the free hand toward the floor — counterbalance)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ Bodyweight × 5 per side (hinge until torso is parallel — pause 1 second)
└─ Set 3: ⛽ Bodyweight × 5 per side (the standing knee stays soft — never locked)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🧸 fero — carry the stimulus into hamstrings and calves

```
🟢🔨🍗🧩 (Supplemental | Legs | Functional | Bodyweight)
```

Rest: 2 min between sets.

**A. 🍗 Nordic Hamstring Curl**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ Bodyweight × 4 (anchor feet under a couch, bar, or partner — lower as slowly as possible, catch yourself, reset)
│   └─ (3–4 second eccentric minimum — this is the whole point)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ Bodyweight × 4 (if the set becomes uncontrolled descents, stop — do not accumulate sloppy reps)

Note: Nordic curls are one of the highest hamstring-stimulus exercises available at bodyweight. Two sets is sufficient.

**B. 🍗 Single-Leg Standing Calf Raise (Bodyweight)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ Bodyweight × 6 per side (full range — heel fully down at the bottom, full rise at the top)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ Bodyweight × 6 per side (pause 1 second at the top — do not bounce)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE
🧸 fero — decompress the hip flexors and hamstrings after unilateral loading

├─ 60 sec × Couch Stretch (Hip Flexor Deep) per side (rear leg up the wall, hold — feel the front of the hip)
├─ 60 sec × Standing Hamstring Stretch (Straight Leg) per side
├─ 8 × Hip CARs per side (slow — closing circles to finish the session)
└─ 30 sec × Deep Squat Hold (Hip Mobility) (feet flat, hands clasped, elbows inside knees)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 🧮 SAVE

The pistol squat is an honest test — you cannot fake balance or hip mobility with a barbell on your back. Log the result: assisted, unassisted, or substituted. That entry is your baseline for this address.
