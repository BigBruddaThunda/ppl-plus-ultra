# 🍗 Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat — Leg Coaching Session 🍗

Strength functional session | Leg Coaching Session | 55–75 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🍗⚫

> "Today you learn to load one leg at a time — where the weight goes, how the hip hinges, and what the back foot is actually doing."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🧸 fero — transfer blood into hips, knees, and ankles before any load

```
⚫🔨🍗♨️ (Warm-Up | Legs | Functional | Teaching)
```

├─ 5 min walk or light bike (easy pace, no urgency)
├─ 10 × Leg Swings (Forward/Back) per leg — keep the standing leg soft
├─ 10 × Leg Swings (Side-to-Side) per leg — let the hip open
├─ 8 × Hip CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations) per side — slow full circles
├─ 8 × Walking Lunge (Bodyweight) — feel where the weight sits
└─ 8 × Box Step-Up (Bodyweight) per side — find your balance point

Rest: Move through continuously, no stops.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — ramp the CNS toward split-stance loading before adding weight

```
⚫🔨🍗▶️ (Primer | Legs | Functional | Teaching)
```

**🍗 Bulgarian Split Squat (Bodyweight) — position teaching**

├─ Set 1: ⚫ Bodyweight × 8 per side (find foot position — front foot far enough that shin is vertical at the bottom)
├─ Set 2: ⚫ Bodyweight × 6 per side (pause 2 sec at the bottom — feel the stretch in the rear hip flexor)
└─ Set 3: ⚫ Bodyweight × 5 per side (drive through the heel of the front foot on the way up)

Rest: 90 sec between sets.
Note: Rear foot elevated on bench or box. Rear foot top-side down. Do not let the rear knee crash into the floor.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🛠 CRAFT
🧸 fero — understand the mechanics before the weight arrives

```
⚫🔨🍗🛠 (Craft | Legs | Functional | Teaching)
```

**Position A — The Descent Check**

├─ 5 × Weighted Bulgarian Split Squat (Dumbbells) per side at light load (~50%)
│   ├─ Coach cue: "Front shin stays close to vertical. Knee tracks over the third toe."
│   ├─ Coach cue: "Hips drop straight down, not forward. Think elevator, not ramp."
│   └─ Pause 2 seconds at the bottom of every rep. Breathe.
└─ Rest: 2 min

**Position B — The Hinge Check**

├─ 5 × Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (Dumbbell) per side at light load (~50%)
│   ├─ Coach cue: "Hinge at the hip, not the lower back. The back leg lifts as a counterweight."
│   ├─ Coach cue: "Soft bend in the standing knee. Do not lock it out."
│   └─ Pause 1 second when the torso is parallel to the floor.
└─ Rest: 2 min

Rest: 2 min between positions.

## 4. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat**
Primary Pattern: **Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat**
🧸 fero — transfer the teaching into loaded strength work

```
⚫🔨🍗🧈 (Bread & Butter | Legs | Functional | Teaching)
```

Rest: 3–4 min between all sets.
Note: Complete all reps on one side before switching. Keep the same load both sides.

**A. 🍗 Weighted Bulgarian Split Squat (Dumbbells)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 per side (first working set — dial in the position before adding)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5 per side (weight feels heavier unilaterally — stay patient)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4 per side (drive the floor away, keep the torso tall)
└─ Set 4: ⛽ 80% × 4 per side (same weight — quality over accumulation)

Load reference: % of estimated single-leg working max, not bilateral squat.

**B. 🍗 Single-Leg Romanian Deadlift (Dumbbell)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 per side (hinge until you feel the hamstring stretch, then return)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5 per side (the free leg is a rudder — use it for balance, not momentum)
└─ Set 3: ⛽ 78% × 5 per side (slow on the way down — 3 seconds minimum)

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🧸 fero — carry the strength into the smaller supporting structures

```
⚫🔨🍗🧩 (Supplemental | Legs | Functional | Teaching)
```

Rest: 2 min between sets.

**A. 🍗 Weighted Box Step-Up (Dumbbells)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 5 per side (step fully onto the box — do not push off the rear foot)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 70% × 5 per side (full extension at the top before stepping down)

**B. 🍗 Single-Leg Standing Calf Raise (Weighted)**

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 6 per side (full range — dead stop at the bottom, pause at the top)
└─ Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 6 per side (do not bounce out of the bottom)

## 🧮 SAVE

The teaching session is about knowing where the load is, not how much. Log which side felt weaker — that asymmetry is the actual training target. The split squat exposes it directly.
