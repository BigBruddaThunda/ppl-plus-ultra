# 🛒 Single-Arm Push-Up Progression — Chest and Triceps, No Equipment 🛒

Bodyweight strength session | Chest, front delts, triceps | 50–65 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🛒🟢

> "If the gym strength does not transfer to a single arm on the floor, it is gym strength only."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🧸 fero — prepare the wrist, shoulder, and serratus

- Shoulder CARs × 5 each side — slow controlled arcs, no momentum
- Arm Circles (Forward) × 20, (Backward) × 20
- Scapular Push-Up × 12 — blade forward and back, spine still
- Band Shoulder External Rotation (Standing) × 15 each side
- Wall Handstand Hold × 2 × 10 sec — active shoulder, ribs in
- Wrist circles and wrist flexor stretch × 30 sec each side

Rest: none — continuous flow.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🧸 fero — ramp into single-arm loading

Archer Push-Up:
- Set 1: ⛽ BW × 5 each side (straight arm tracks wide, bent arm presses — feel the unilateral load)
- Set 2: ⛽ BW × 4 each side (control the descent 3 sec, press smooth)
- Set 3: ⛽ BW × 3 each side (go slower — this is neural prep, not fatigue)

Rest: 90 sec between sets.

Coaching note: The Archer Push-Up at this pace is the bridge from bilateral to single-arm. If someone cannot control 3 reps per side here, the Single-Arm Push-Up in the Bread & Butter will not produce strength — it will produce struggle. Read the primer reps honestly.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Archer Push-Up**
🧸 fero — carry the full load on one side

Sub-block: 🟢🔨🛒🟢 (Bodyweight | Functional | Push | Bodyweight)

Rest: 3–4 min between all sets.

**A. 🛒 Single-Arm Push-Up**

The real test. One hand, ground-based, full depth, controlled.

Scaling note: If unassisted single-arm is not yet controlled, substitute Archer Push-Up loaded toward 90% single-arm emphasis. The Order ceiling still applies — if it becomes sloppy, it is not strength training.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ BW × 4 each side (feet wide for balance, lower chest to fist height)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ BW × 4 each side (feet together if able — harder, more honest)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ BW × 3 each side (pause 1 sec at bottom — no momentum out of the hole)
├─ Set 4: ⛽ BW × 3 each side (match quality of set 3)

Rest: 4 min. These are hard reps. Treat them like a barbell set at 80%.

**B. 🛒 Deficit Push-Up (unilateral emphasis via staggered hands)**

Hands on two plates or books — one higher than the other. The pressing arm works through a greater range of motion.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ BW × 5 each side (pressing arm on the deficit surface)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ BW × 5 each side (scapular protraction at top, no shrugging)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ BW × 4 each side (slow lower 3 sec, explosive press)

Rest: 3 min.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🧸 fero — tricep and shoulder lock-out under single-arm conditions

Sub-block: 🟢🔨🛒🟢 (Bodyweight | Functional | Push | Bodyweight)

Rest: 2–3 min

**🛒 Diamond Push-Up**

Close grip, elbows track back not out — tricep dominant.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ BW × 6 (elbows in, lock out fully at top)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ BW × 6 (lower 4 sec, press 1 sec)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ BW × 5 (if reps degrade to 4, stop — log the number)

Rest: 2 min 30 sec.

**🛒 Pike Push-Up**

Overhead pushing pattern without the wall. Hips high, head through at the bottom.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ BW × 5 (press straight down and up, not forward)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ BW × 5 (pause at the bottom — nose near floor)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ BW × 4 (feet elevated on bench if available — harder angle)

Rest: 2 min 30 sec.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

Decompress the shoulder girdle after unilateral loading

- Thread the Needle (Chest Rotation) × 45 sec each side — open the anterior shoulder without forcing
- Doorway Chest Stretch × 30 sec × 2 — one arm at a time, not both simultaneously
- Child's Pose (Shoulder Stretch) × 60 sec — tricep long, shoulder decompressed
- Shoulder CARs × 3 each side — slow, not stretched, just reintegrating range

                    (pull the unilateral bodyweight row — antagonist next)

← ⛽🔨➕🟢   •   ⛽🔨🛒🟢   → ⛽🔨🍗🟢
  (carries and power without gym equipment)      (legs: pistols and split patterns)

               ↓ 🖼🔨➖🟢
                    (body-only recovery, keep the functional lens)
```

- ⛽🔨🛒🔵 — take the pattern back to weighted, see if the transfer held
- ⛽🔨➕🟢 — carries and explosive work without equipment
- 🖼🔨➖🟢 — recover the CNS and shoulder, no load

## 🧮 SAVE

Bodyweight strength is not easier than the bar — it is a different test. If the single-arm push-ups are shaky but the barbell press is solid, the gym strength has not transferred. That gap is the next thing to close.
