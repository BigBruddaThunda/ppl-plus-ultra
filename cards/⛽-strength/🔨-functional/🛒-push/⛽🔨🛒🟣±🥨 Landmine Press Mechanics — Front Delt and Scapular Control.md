# 🛒 Landmine Press Mechanics — Front Delt and Scapular Control 🛒

Technical strength session | Chest, front delts, triceps | 65–80 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🛒🟣

> "The session ends when the quality ends — not when the clock does."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🥨 tendo — precision preparation for a precision session

- Shoulder CARs × 5 each side — deliberate, feel every degree of range
- Wall Slide × 10 — shoulder blade control, no shrug
- Scapular Push-Up × 10 — serratus activation before the session demands it
- Landmine Rainbow Press × 6 each side at light load — arc is perfect or you stop and reset
- Bottoms-Up Kettlebell Press × 5 each side at 30% — balance reveals instability before load does

Rest: none — deliberate pace throughout.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🥨 tendo — ramp into technical demands before adding load

Bottoms-Up Kettlebell Press:
- Set 1: ⛽ 40% × 4 each side (shoulder packed — if the bell wobbles, the shoulder is not set)
- Set 2: ⛽ 50% × 4 each side (wrist neutral, elbow stacked below fist)
- Set 3: ⛽ 55% × 3 each side (this is the technical gateway — not warm-up, not volume)

Rest: 2 min between ramp sets.

Note: The Bottoms-Up KB press is not the main movement. It is a diagnostic and activation tool. If balance cannot be maintained at 55% here, reduce main work load by one notch and extend rest to 5 min.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Landmine Press**
🥨 tendo — extend the reach of what you can control

Sub-block: 🟣🔨🛒🟣 (Technical | Functional | Push | Technical)

Rest: 4–5 min between all sets. Session ends when technical quality degrades — do not complete a set with compromised reps.

**A. 🛒 Single-Arm Dumbbell Overhead Press (Standing)**

The technical baseline. Every rep must be identical.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 78% × 5 each side (non-dominant first — lock the shoulder before pressing, not during)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 82% × 4 each side (if one side loses position at rep 4, stop at 3)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 85% × 4 each side (this is the ceiling — clean 4 reps or controlled 3)
├─ Set 4: ⛽ 85% × 4 each side (only if sets 1–3 were clean — skip if quality dropped)

Rest: 5 min. No compromise.

**B. 🛒 Bottoms-Up Kettlebell Press (Standing)**

The technical filter. If the bell stays up, the mechanics are sound.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 58% × 4 each side (press smoothly — jerky rep = soft position somewhere)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 62% × 3 each side (wrist neutral, elbow path deliberate)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 62% × 3 each side (stop at any uncontrolled wobble — the bell tells the truth)

Rest: 4 min.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🥨 tendo — finish with precision, not volume

Sub-block: 🟣🔨🛒🟣 (Technical | Functional | Push | Technical)

Rest: 3 min

**🛒 Single-Arm Cable Press (Split Stance)**

Cable keeps constant tension through the range. Use it to find the weak point in the arc.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 5 each side (cable at chest height, press forward and slightly up)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 73% × 5 each side (watch for elbow flare — lock the path)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 73% × 4 each side

Rest: 3 min.

- ⛽🔨🪡🟣 — pull the technical unilateral pattern — antagonist, same precision format
- ⛽🔨🛒🔵 — same press, structured format — track whether technical work improved rep quality
- ⛽🔨➕🟣 — technical power work: KB snatch, overhead carry, loaded carry precision
- 🖼🔨➖🟣 — CNS recovery, technical awareness remains active

## 🧮 SAVE

Technical sessions are short because the quality window closes. The sets that happened after quality dropped are not in the log — they did not count. What counts is the top set at maximum control, and whether it moved since last time.
