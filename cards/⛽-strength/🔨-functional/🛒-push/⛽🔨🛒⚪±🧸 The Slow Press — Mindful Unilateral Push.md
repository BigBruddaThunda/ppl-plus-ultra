# 🛒 The Slow Press — Mindful Unilateral Push 🛒

Mindful strength session | Chest, front delts, triceps | 65–80 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🛒⚪

> "The slow descent is where the work happens. The press is the result of what built up on the way down."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🧸 fero — arrive at a pace that matches the session

Tempo throughout warm-up: deliberate, breath-driven, no rushing.

- Neck CARs × 5 slow rotations — settle the nervous system before reaching the shoulder
- Shoulder CARs × 5 each side — 5 seconds per degree of arc, not mechanical rotation
- Thread the Needle (Chest Rotation) × 5 each side — exhale as you rotate open
- Wall Slide × 10 — 4-second ascent, blade moving without the shoulder rising
- Scapular Push-Up × 10 — 3-second lower, 2-second hold at protraction, slow return
- Band Overhead Press × 12 — 4-second press up, 4-second lower

Rest: none — but the pace is slow. 2 seconds between each warm-up exercise.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🧸 fero — ramp to working load with tempo intact

Single-Arm Dumbbell Overhead Press (Standing):
- Set 1: ⛽ 50% × 4 each side — 4-second press / 4-second lower (breathe out on press, in on lower)
- Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 4 each side — same tempo (feel the shoulder load build on the descent)
- Set 3: ⛽ 67% × 3 each side — same tempo (if the slow lower reveals compensation, adjust position)

Rest: 2 min between ramp sets.

Breathing cue throughout: exhale the press, inhale the lower. Don't hold breath on slow eccentrics — the tempo is only useful if the breath supports it.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

🧸 fero — load the press with the slow descent as the governing rule

Sub-block: ⚪🔨🛒⚪ (Mindful | Functional | Push | Mindful)

**Tempo rule for all Bread & Butter sets: 4-second eccentric (lower), 1-second pause at bottom, press at controlled speed (not slow, but not explosive). No grinding — the load must permit the tempo.**

Rest: 2 min 30 sec between all sets.

**A. 🛒 Single-Arm Dumbbell Overhead Press (Standing)**

The tempo reveals what bilateral pressing hides.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 72% × 5 each side
│   (4-second lower — feel the shoulder blade settle, don't chase it)
│   (exhale through the press — full exhale, not a grunt)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 5 each side
│   (pause at the bottom — is the shoulder still packed? Reset if not.)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 77% × 4 each side
│   (the 4-second lower at 77% is work — do not rush it)
├─ Set 4: ⛽ 77% × 4 each side
│   (match set 3 — quality, not load, is the ceiling here)

Rest: 2 min 30 sec.

**B. 🛒 Landmine Press (Single Arm, Half-Kneeling)**

Down knee reduces variables. The press is quiet and clean.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 68% × 5 each side
│   (4-second lower along the landmine arc — feel the anterior delt stretch at the bottom)
│   (inhale on the way down, exhale through the press)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 72% × 4 each side
│   (hip square — if the pelvis rotates on the lower, the load is too high)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 72% × 4 each side

Rest: 2 min 30 sec.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🧸 fero — tricep long-head extension under slow tempo

Sub-block: ⚪🔨🛒⚪ (Mindful | Functional | Push | Mindful)

Rest: 2 min

**🛒 Single-Arm Overhead Dumbbell Extension**

Longest range of motion for the tricep. Slow eccentric here is the work.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 62% × 5 each side
│   (4-second lower — tricep long-head under sustained stretch)
│   (elbow stays high — if it drifts forward, the load is too heavy)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 65% × 5 each side
│   (breathe out on extension — the exhale drives the press)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 65% × 4 each side

Rest: 2 min.

**🛒 Close-Grip Push-Up (slow tempo)**

Tricep compound at end of session, bodyweight, slow.

├─ Set 1: BW × 6 (4-second lower, pause 1 sec at floor, press smooth)
├─ Set 2: BW × 5 (same)
├─ Set 3: BW × 5

Rest: 2 min.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE

⚪ context — tension DOWN, parasympathetic engagement

- Child's Pose (Shoulder Stretch) × 90 sec — breathe into the upper back, let it soften
- Doorway Chest Stretch × 45 sec each side — no forcing, just gravity and exhale
- Foam Roll Pecs × 60 sec each side — pause, breathe into the pressure, exhale and soften
- PNF Chest Stretch (Contract-Relax) × 3 rounds each side
  (contract 5 sec / release and breathe / find 5% more range on the exhale)
- Shoulder CARs × 3 each side — close the session the same way it opened

## 🧮 SAVE

The 4-second eccentric at strength loads is not a recovery tool — it is a different stimulus that demands more from the connective tissue and the nervous system's ability to stay organized under slow load. What felt controlled on the way down at 75% is the real measure of where the shoulder system is.
