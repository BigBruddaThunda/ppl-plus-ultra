# 🛒 Standing Dumbbell Press — Shoulder Coaching Session 🛒

Strength functional session | Shoulder Coaching Session | 55–75 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🛒⚫

> "Learn what the arm is doing when there is nothing on the other side to compensate."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🧸 fero — arrive in the shoulder, not at the bar

- Arm Circles (Forward) × 20, Arm Circles (Backward) × 20
- Shoulder CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations) × 5 each side — slow, full arc, no cheating range
- Scapular Push-Up × 10 — feel the blade move before you load it
- Band Shoulder External Rotation (Standing) × 15 each side
- Wall Slide × 10 — shoulder packed, ribs down

Rest: none — continuous, deliberate pace.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🧸 fero — establish unilateral baseline before loading

Single-Arm Dumbbell Overhead Press:
- Set 1: ⛽ 50% × 5 each side (find the sticking point, don't force it)
- Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 4 each side (shoulder packed, ribs closed)
- Set 3: ⛽ 65% × 3 each side (stop, reset, confirm position between reps)

Rest: 90 sec between ramp sets.

Coaching note: Watch for the trunk lateral-flexing to help the press. If the torso leans, the shoulder isn't pressing — the whole body is. Identify this in the primer. Address it in the Craft block.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🛠 CRAFT

🧸 fero — isolate the mechanic before you load it

Sub-block: ⚫🔨🛒⚫ (Teaching | Functional | Push | Teaching)

This block exists because something broke in the primer. Either the shoulder was late, the trunk compensated, or the elbow path wandered. Pick the fault. Fix it here.

**A. Landmine Press (Single Arm)**

The arc of a landmine press self-limits bad mechanics. Use it.

├─ Position: Split stance, same-side foot forward, press from the hip line up
├─ 3 sets × 6 reps each side
│  Set 1: ⛽ 55% × 6 (elbows drives forward, not out)
│  Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 6 (same-side hip stays square)
│  Set 3: ⛽ 65% × 5 (stop if the trunk rotates to help)

Rest: 2 min + coaching reset between sets.

**B. Wall Handstand Hold (active shoulder position study)**

Not a press. A position.

├─ Kick up to wall, arms locked, shoulder blades spread and pressed toward ceiling
├─ Hold 15–20 sec × 3 rounds
│  (ribs in, active pressing — not hanging into the joint)

Rest: 90 sec between holds.

Coaching note: If handstand hold is not yet accessible, substitute: Single-Arm Overhead Dumbbell Hold × 20 sec at 50% — same shoulder packing intent.

## 4. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Standing Dumbbell Press**
Primary Pattern: **Standing Dumbbell Press**

🧸 fero — now press with what you just built

Sub-block: ⚫🔨🛒⚫ (Teaching | Functional | Push | Teaching)

Rest: 4 min between all sets. (Teaching color — extra rest is the rule, not the exception.)

**A. 🛒 Single-Arm Dumbbell Overhead Press (Standing)**

The standard. One arm, full stand. No wall. No seat.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 each side (pause at top — is the shoulder stacked?)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5 each side (trunk stays neutral — note which side wanders)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side (stop the rep if form breaks before rep ends)
├─ Set 4: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side (match quality of set 3, not the load)

Rest: 4 min. Log which side is stronger and which compensates more.

**B. 🛒 Half-Kneeling Single-Arm Landmine Press**

Down knee eliminates leg drive. The press is pure upper body.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 5 each side (hip square, do not let the pelvis shift)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 5 each side (ribcage down, press through the arc)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 75% × 4 each side (check: is the pressing shoulder higher than the resting side?)

Rest: 4 min.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL

🧸 fero — reinforce what you identified

Sub-block: ⚫🔨🛒⚫ (Teaching | Functional | Push | Teaching)

Rest: 3 min

**🛒 Single-Arm Overhead Cable Extension (tricep lock-out reinforcement)**

The tricep is the final link in overhead pressing. If the top range is soft, this is why.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 65% × 6 each side (full lock-out, hold 1 sec at top)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 68% × 5 each side (elbow stays high, don't let it drop)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 68% × 5 each side (quality over load)

Rest: 3 min.

**🛒 Serratus Punch (Dumbbell) — scapular tracking after load**

├─ 3 sets × 8 each side at light load
├─ (blade forward on the punch, controlled back on return)

Rest: 2 min.

## 🧮 SAVE

Single-arm pressing exposes which side leads and which side masks weakness behind bilateral loading. What you found in the Craft block is the actual gap — log it, because that is the thing the next session needs to address.
