# 🛒 Kettlebell Press and Push-Up Rotation — Shoulder and Chest Stations 🛒

Circuit strength session | Chest, front delts, triceps | 50–65 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🛒🟠

> "The circuit is not a list of exercises done quickly — it is a deliberate rotation that lets each tissue recover while the others work."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🥨 tendo — move through all push tissues before loading any

- Arm Circles (Forward) × 20, (Backward) × 20
- Shoulder CARs × 4 each side
- Scapular Push-Up × 12 — serratus primed
- Band Overhead Press × 15 — anterior delt open
- Band Tricep Pushdown × 15 — elbow joint warm
- Archer Push-Up × 5 each side at BW — everything together, no load

Rest: none.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. 🎱 ARAM — Push Station Loop

🥨 tendo — station rotation, deliberate tissue sequence

Sub-block: 🟠🔨🛒🟠 (Circuit | Functional | Push | Circuit)

**Loop Logic:** Each station changes which push tissue is primary. No two adjacent stations hit the same muscle group. The tissue working at one station is recovering while the next station works a different part of the push chain.

**Circuit: 4 stations. 3 rounds. 40 sec work / 20 sec transition.**

Rest between rounds: 3 min (⛽ Order — rest is the rule, not the exception, even in circuits).

```

**Station A — 🛒 Chest: Single-Arm Landmine Press (Standing, Split Stance)**
Primary: Chest (pec major, sternal head), anterior delt secondary
- Work 40 sec each side (switch sides at 20 sec mark)
- Load: ⛽ 70% of working landmine weight
- (elbow forward, press through the arc — not a punch, a press)

**Station B — 🛒 Triceps: Single-Arm Tricep Pushdown (Cable or Band)**
Primary: Triceps brachii — chest is recovering
- Work 40 sec each side (switch at 20 sec)
- Load: ⛽ 65% of working pushdown weight
- (elbow pinned at side — if it moves, the weight is too heavy)

**Station C — 🛒 Front Delt: Dumbbell Front Raise (Alternating)**
Primary: Anterior deltoid — tricep is recovering, chest continuing to recover
- Work 40 sec alternating arms
- Load: ⛽ 60% of working front raise weight
- (stop at shoulder height — above that is trap, not delt)

**Station D — 🛒 Chest + Shoulder: Archer Push-Up (Bodyweight)**
Primary: Chest (pec major), serratus, front delt — tricep recovering from Station B
- Work 40 sec alternating sides (5 sec per rep — controlled)
- Load: BW
- (straight arm wide, bent arm presses — feel the unilateral chest load)

**20 sec to rotate to next station.**

Rounds: 3 total. Rest 3 min between rounds.

Note on ⛽ load: At 40 seconds of work with strength-range loads, reps will be 3–5 per set per side. This satisfies the ⛽ rep range within the circuit format. Do not increase load to chase more reps — the rest-to-work ratio already creates the stimulus.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🪫 RELEASE

Decompress the shoulder girdle and wrists after circuit load

- Doorway Chest Stretch × 30 sec each side
- Thread the Needle (Chest Rotation) × 30 sec each side
- Child's Pose (Shoulder Stretch) × 60 sec — reach long, decompress
- Wrist flexor stretch × 30 sec each side — circuits demand grip endurance

## 🧮 SAVE

The circuit exposes endurance in the push pattern, not just strength. If round 3 drops more than one rep from round 1 at the same load, the aerobic base inside the push pattern needs work. That is information — log it and route to ➖ Ultra next.
