# 🛒 Mixed Grip and Angle Press — Chest and Shoulder Variety Day 🛒

Exploratory strength session | Chest, front delts, triceps | 55–70 min

CODE: ⛽🔨🛒🟡

> "Same muscle groups, different angles — find the one that feels like it was missing."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP

🧸 fero — arrive with curiosity, not habit

- Shoulder CARs × 5 each side — feel the full arc, not just the familiar range
- Arm Circles (Forward) × 20, (Backward) × 20
- Scapular Push-Up × 12
- T Push-Up × 6 each side — rotation built into the warm-up
- Band Overhead Press × 15 — loose and exploratory, not mechanical

Rest: none.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER

🧸 fero — try a new entry point before anchoring to the main work

Landmine Rainbow Press × 6 each side at 50%:
- Set 1: ⛽ 50% × 6 each side (arc from low to high — find where the shoulder is happiest)
- Set 2: ⛽ 60% × 5 each side (stop at the top, feel the shoulder position there)
- Set 3: ⛽ 65% × 4 each side (this is the ramp, not the session — leave something for the work)

Rest: 90 sec between sets.

Note: The landmine arc covers multiple shoulder angles in a single movement. Using it as a primer before the Bread & Butter gives the shoulder a movement preview it would not get from a standard overhead ramp.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER


Primary Pattern: **Alternating Dumbbell Press**
🧸 fero — the main press, but chosen for this session

Sub-block: 🟡🔨🛒🟡 (Fun | Functional | Push | Fun)

Rest: 3–4 min between all sets.

**A. 🛒 Single-Arm Dumbbell Overhead Press (Split Stance)**

This session's anchor. Split stance changes the stability demand compared to the standard standing press — the hip and trunk are in the game.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 each side (same-side foot forward or opposite — try both and pick the one with better overhead position)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 78% × 5 each side (lock in the stance that won)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side (note: does one stance produce cleaner reps? Log it.)
├─ Set 4: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side

Rest: 3 min 30 sec.

**B. 🛒 Single-Arm Landmine Press (Chest Focus, Standing)**

Different arc than overhead. The anterior delt and chest work at a different angle — this is the one session to explore both on the same day.

├─ Set 1: ⛽ 70% × 5 each side (press from hip height, arc up through chest angle)
├─ Set 2: ⛽ 73% × 5 each side (find the position where the chest is doing the work, not the shoulder)
├─ Set 3: ⛽ 75% × 4 each side

Rest: 3 min.

## 4. 🏖 SANDBOX

🧸 fero — constrained exploration within functional push

Sub-block: 🟡🔨🛒🟡 (Fun | Functional | Push | Fun)

The sandbox has two rules: (1) the exercise must train chest, front delt, or tricep, and (2) it must be a movement you have not done in the last 3 sessions. Everything else is open.

Choose 2 from the options below, or propose your own that fits the constraints.

**Option Pool — pick any 2:**

├─ A. 🛒 Half-Kneeling Cable Press — 3 × 5 each side at ⛽ 68%
│     (down knee kills the leg drive — the press is isolated to upper body)

├─ B. 🛒 T Push-Up — 3 × 5 each side at BW
│     (rotation loads the trunk and serratus; this is not just a push-up)

├─ C. 🛒 Dumbbell Kickback (single-arm, incline bench) — 3 × 6 each side at ⛽ 65%
│     (elbow pinned at hip height — full extension at the top, slow lower)

├─ D. 🛒 Spiderman Push-Up — 3 × 5 each side at BW
│     (knee to elbow as you lower — trunk rotates, chest loads unilaterally)

├─ E. 🛒 Lu Raise (shoulder complex: front delt into lateral delt rotation) — 3 × 8 at ⛽ 55%
│     (start as a front raise, rotate out to lateral at the top — the shoulder hates the transition at first)

Rest: 2 min 30 sec between sandbox sets.

Log which two you chose and a note on how they felt. That note informs the next 🟡 session.

## 🧮 SAVE

The sandbox note is the output of this session. The load data is secondary. If one of the sandbox choices revealed something — a range of motion gap, an angle that loaded the pec differently, a stance that cleaned up the press — that is what transfers forward.
