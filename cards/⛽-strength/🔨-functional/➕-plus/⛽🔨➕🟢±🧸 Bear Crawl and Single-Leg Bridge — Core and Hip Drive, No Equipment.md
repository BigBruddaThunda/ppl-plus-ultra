# ➕ Bear Crawl and Single-Leg Bridge — Core and Hip Drive, No Equipment ➕

Bodyweight functional power | Full-body power, core stability | 55–65 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➕🟢

> "The gym wall is gone. Find out what your body can produce without it."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🟢🔨➕♨️ (Warm-Up | Movement prep | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 8 min

├─ 60 sec: Bear Crawl (Serratus Load) — slow, flat back, breathe
│  (hips level, shoulders loaded, no sagging)
├─ 60 sec: Inchworm — full ROM, control the descent
│  (hamstrings long, feel the walk-out)
├─ 60 sec: World's Greatest Stretch — alternating, 5 each side
│  (open the hip, reach the arm, pause at each position)
├─ 60 sec: Bird Dog (Anti-Extension) — slow, hold 2 sec at extension
│  (opposite arm and leg, don't rotate)
├─ 60 sec: Hollow Body Hold — 20 sec on, 20 sec rest × 2
│  (low back pressed into floor, ribs down)
└─ 2 min: Dead Bug — 8 reps each side, slow exhale on every rep
   (the arm and leg that stay fixed are doing more work than the ones that move)

Rest: None — continuous warm-up flow.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — 🟢🔨➕▶️ (Primer | CNS activation | Functional | Tier 0–1)

Duration: 6 min

├─ **A. Band Pallof Press × 6 reps each side**
│  ├─ 2 sets, split-stance
│  │  (hips square, band pulls you open — don't let it)
│  └─ Rest 60 sec between sides
│
└─ **B. Bear Crawl — forward + backward × 10m each**
   ├─ 2 rounds
   │  (slow and controlled — this is neural activation, not conditioning)
   └─ Rest 60 sec between rounds

Coaching note: Bodyweight strength is not a rest day. The primer raises CNS readiness without the barbell. Bear crawl in particular primes ipsilateral and contralateral patterning at low load before the main work.

Rest: 60 sec between exercises.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

Primary Pattern: **Bear Crawl**
🧸 fero — 🟢🔨➕🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary loading | Functional | Tier 0–2)

Rest: 3–4 min between sets.

No barbell. No rack. The load here is bodyweight position and band tension. The check valve: does your strength transfer outside the gym?

**A. ➕ Turkish Get-Up (Full)**
Tier: 0 (bodyweight only — no implement)
Primary demand: Full-body integration, anti-rotation, hip mobility under load.

- Set 1: ⛽ Bodyweight × 3 each side — slow, deliberate
  (one position at a time — don't rush the transitions)
- Set 2: ⛽ Bodyweight × 3 each side
  (the standing position is a pause, not a pass-through)
- Set 3: ⛽ Bodyweight × 4 each side
  (hips stay in the plane — no rotation at the hinge point)
- Set 4: ⛽ Bodyweight × 4 each side
  (final set: identify the slowest transition — that is the gap)

Note: 3–4 reps each side per set falls within ⛽ rep ceiling. Turkish Get-Up is full CNS demand at bodyweight when executed correctly.

Rest: 3 min between sets (each side counts as one set).

**B. ➕ Single-Arm Push-Up to Rotation**
Tier: 0
Primary demand: Anti-rotation, unilateral pressing, oblique engagement.

- Set 1: ⛽ 4 reps each side
  (push-up, then rotate — the top position is a side plank, hold 2 sec)
- Set 2: ⛽ 4 reps each side
  (don't let the hips sag on the rotation — everything moves as one unit)
- Set 3: ⛽ 5 reps each side
  (feet together = harder; staggered = more stable — choose based on control)
- Set 4: ⛽ 5 reps each side
  (if the shoulder drops on rotation, slow down before adding reps)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🧸 fero — 🟢🔨➕🧩 (Supplemental | Anti-rotation core | Functional | Tier 0–1)

Rest: 2–3 min between sets.

**A. ➕ Offset Farmer's Walk (Anti-Rotation) — bodyweight variation: Single-Arm Overhead Hold Walk**
Tier 1 (band or no implement)
Primary demand: Anti-lateral flexion, overhead stability.

- Set 1: ⛽ Bodyweight × 20m each side (arm overhead, no implement)
  (the overhead arm teaches the shoulder position — overhead carry starts here)
- Set 2: ⛽ Band resistance overhead × 15m each side (band anchored low, arm overhead)
  (the band creates lateral pull — the oblique resists it)
- Set 3: ⛽ Band resistance overhead × 15m each side
  (breathe normally — if you hold your breath, the core wall collapses under load)

Rest: 90 sec between sides, 2 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Plank with Single-Arm Reach**
Tier: 0
Primary demand: Anti-rotation, scapular stability, TVA engagement.

- Set 1: ⛽ 5 reps each arm — hold 3 sec at extension
  (reach far — the longer the lever, the more the oblique works)
- Set 2: ⛽ 6 reps each arm
  (hips stay level, don't shift to compensate — if they do, shorten the reach)
- Set 3: ⛽ 6 reps each arm
  (tempo: 2 sec out, 3 sec hold, 2 sec return)

Rest: 2 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE
🟢🔨➕🪫 (Release | Parasympathetic transition | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 6 min

The release here is active decompression — moving the spine in directions opposite to the carry patterns that loaded it.

├─ 90 sec: Cat-Cow (Core Mobility) — slow, full range
│  (exhale on cat, inhale on cow — let the spine breathe)
├─ 60 sec: Supine Spinal Twist — 30 sec each side
│  (knees stack, shoulders stay flat, don't force the rotation)
├─ 60 sec: Child's Pose (Core Release) — arms extended, forehead down
│  (breathe into the lower back, feel it expand on each inhale)
└─ 90 sec: Dead Bug — slow, 4 reps each side, gentle
   (not fatiguing — resetting the TVA for tissue recovery)

Rest: None — continuous, slow movement.

## 🧮 SAVE

Bodyweight strength is the check valve for gym strength. What survived the bar removal is what actually belongs to you. The gap between barbell performance and bodyweight performance is the gap in the training.
