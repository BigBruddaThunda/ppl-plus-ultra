CODE: ⛽🔨➕🟠

> "Five stations, five tissues. The loop recovers one while the next works."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🟠🔨➕♨️ (Warm-Up | Circuit prep | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 8 min

Walk the stations during the warm-up. Know where you're going before the clock starts.

├─ 2 min: General movement — hip CARs, shoulder circles, wrist rotations
├─ 60 sec: Dead Bug — 5 slow reps each side
│  (the anti-extension base for everything in the circuit)
├─ 60 sec: Bear Crawl — 10m forward, 10m back
│  (serratus and core — the two connective threads of the whole loop)
├─ 60 sec: Station walk-through — light effort at each station, 2 reps only
│  (this is orientation, not training — get the feel of each position)
└─ 2 min: Suitcase hold light × 20 sec each side + Band Pallof Press × 5 each side
   (confirm the anti-rotation pattern before the loop loads it)

Rest: None.

## 2. 🎱 ARAM
🥨 tendo — 🟠🔨➕🎱 (ARAM | Station-based power loop | Functional | Tier 0–3)

**Loop Logic:** Each station changes which tissue is working. No two adjacent stations target the same muscle group. The station that is resting is recovering while the others work.

**Circuit Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  STATION 1 → STATION 2 → STATION 3 → STATION 4 → STATION 5 → (rest) → repeat
│
│  Station 1: ➕ Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm)
│             Anti-lateral flexion | QL, obliques | Tier 2
│
│  Station 2: ➕ Pallof Press with Rotation (Cable)
│             Anti-rotation + rotational power | Obliques | Tier 2–3
│
│  Station 3: ➕ Bear Crawl (Serratus Load)
│             Serratus, upper back, hip stabilizers | Tier 0
│
│  Station 4: ➕ Reverse Wood Chop (Cable Low-to-High)
│             Rotational power, obliques, shoulder | Tier 2–3
│             (opposite diagonal from Station 2 — tissue alternation maintained)
│
│  Station 5: ➕ Dead Bug (Anti-Extension)
│             TVA, hip flexors, anti-extension | Tier 0
│             (lower intensity station — partial recovery before the loop repeats)
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Loop Logic Verification:**
- Station 1 (carries) → anti-lateral QL/oblique
- Station 2 (Pallof with rotation) → oblique/rotational power → ADJACENT? Station 1 and 2 both hit obliques. Adjust: Station 2 becomes Bear Crawl.
- Revised order for clean loop:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  REVISED LOOP — tissue alternation confirmed:
│
│  Station 1: ➕ Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm)
│             Primary tissue: QL, obliques (anti-lateral)
│
│  Station 2: ➕ Bear Crawl (Serratus Load)
│             Primary tissue: Serratus, shoulder, hip stabilizers
│             (different tissue from Station 1 — confirmed)
│
│  Station 3: ➕ Pallof Press with Rotation
│             Primary tissue: Obliques (rotational) + thoracic stabilizers
│             (different from Station 2 — confirmed; oblique load returns here, not adjacent to Station 1)
│
│  Station 4: ➕ Dead Bug (Anti-Extension)
│             Primary tissue: TVA, hip flexors, rectus
│             (different from Station 3 — confirmed)
│
│  Station 5: ➕ Reverse Wood Chop (Cable Low-to-High)
│             Primary tissue: Obliques (diagonal), shoulder, hip
│             (different from Station 4 — confirmed; connects back to Station 1 with serratus/carry recovery)
│
│  Loop passes: no two adjacent stations share primary tissue.
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Station Prescriptions:**

**Station 1: ➕ Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm)**
Format: Distance-based. 20m each side = 1 round at this station.
- Round 1: ⛽ 70% effort × 20m each side
  (walk at pace, not slow — this is a strength carry, not a stroll)
- Round 2: ⛽ 75% × 20m each side
- Round 3: ⛽ 75% × 20m each side
- Round 4: ⛽ 80% × 15m each side
  (top load, reduced distance — loop integrity over rep count)

**Station 2: ➕ Bear Crawl (Serratus Load)**
Format: Distance. 10m forward + 10m back = 1 round.
- Round 1–4: ⛽ Bodyweight × 10m forward + 10m back
  (flat back, controlled breathing, hips level — slower is harder)

**Station 3: ➕ Pallof Press with Rotation**
Format: Reps. 5 each side = 1 round. Cable at navel height.
- Round 1: ⛽ 5 each side — moderate load
  (press, pause, rotate — three distinct positions per rep)
- Round 2: ⛽ 5 each side
- Round 3: ⛽ 5 each side — same or slight load increase
- Round 4: ⛽ 6 each side
  (within ⛽ rep ceiling — top rep count at this station)

**Station 4: ➕ Dead Bug (Anti-Extension)**
Format: Reps. 6 each side = 1 round.
- Round 1–4: ⛽ Bodyweight × 6 each side — slow, 3 sec lowering
  (this is the active recovery station — controlled breathing throughout)
  (low back stays down; if it arches, shorten the reach)

**Station 5: ➕ Reverse Wood Chop (Cable Low-to-High)**
Format: Reps. 5 each side = 1 round. Cable at ankle height.
- Round 1: ⛽ 5 each side — moderate load
  (hips rotate, arms deliver — same rule as the regular chop)
- Round 2: ⛽ 5 each side
- Round 3: ⛽ 5 each side
- Round 4: ⛽ 6 each side
  (the chop closes the loop by connecting carry anti-rotation to rotational expression)

**Circuit Format:**
- Move station to station with minimal transition time (30–45 sec)
- Full rest between complete loops: 3 min (⛽ CNS demand requires this)
- Total loops: 4
- Total duration: approximately 35–40 min working time

Note: Reps at each station stay within ⛽ range (4–6 per side) or distance equivalent. The circuit format does not override the Order parameters — rest is still 3 min between full loops.

## 3. 🪫 RELEASE
🟠🔨➕🪫 (Release | Tissue decompression | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 5 min

Circuit format creates cumulative lateral chain fatigue. Release targets the QL and obliques.

├─ 60 sec: QL Stretch (Side-Lying) — 30 sec each side
│  (the heaviest work was lateral — this addresses it directly)
├─ 60 sec: Supine Spinal Twist — 30 sec each side
│  (derotation after Pallof and wood chop demand)
├─ 60 sec: Child's Pose (Core Release) — full exhale at bottom
│  (decompress the thoracolumbar fascia)
└─ 2 min: Foam Roll Obliques — slow, 5 passes per side
   (the circuit hits the obliques from four angles — they earned the foam roll)

Rest: None.

## 🧮 SAVE

Circuit format exposes which stations slow the loop — that is the weakest functional link. The station that costs the most recovery time between loops is the station to program most deliberately next session.
