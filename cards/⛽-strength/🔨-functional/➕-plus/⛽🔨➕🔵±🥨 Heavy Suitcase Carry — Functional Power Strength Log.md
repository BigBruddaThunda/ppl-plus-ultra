# ➕ Heavy Suitcase Carry — Functional Power Strength Log ➕

Structured loaded carry | Full-body power, core stability | 60–70 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➕🔵

> "Every distance you cover under load is a rep. Log the weight and the meters."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🔵🔨➕♨️ (Warm-Up | Tissue prep | Functional | Tier 0–1)

Duration: 8 min

├─ 60 sec: Hip CARs — standing, one hand on wall, 5 circles each direction per side
├─ 60 sec: Thoracic rotation — seated on bench, hands behind head, 10 each side
├─ 60 sec: Dead Bug — 6 slow reps each side
│  (exhale as the limbs extend, keep the low back pressed down)
├─ 60 sec: Bear Crawl (Serratus Load) — 10m forward, 10m back
│  (controlled, no hip sag)
├─ 90 sec: Band Pallof Press × 8 reps each side — light band
│  (hips square, brace before pressing)
└─ 90 sec: Suitcase hold (light KB) — 30 sec each side, stationary
   (find the lateral tilt, correct it, feel the oblique engage)

Rest: None.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🥨 tendo — 🔵🔨➕▶️ (Primer | CNS ramp | Functional | Tier 2)

Duration: 6 min

Work up to the carry weight. Two warm-up trips per carry pattern before the main block.

├─ **A. Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm) × 20m each side — 60% working weight**
│  ├─ 1 trip each side
│  │  (confirm the lateral tilt stays neutral before the load goes up)
│  └─ Rest 60 sec between sides
│
└─ **B. Single-Arm Overhead Carry (Anti-Rotation) × 15m each side — 60% working weight**
   ├─ 1 trip each side
   │  (lock the elbow, pack the shoulder, walk slow)
   └─ Rest 60 sec between sides

Rest: 90 sec before moving to the main block.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER

Primary Pattern: **Heavy Suitcase Carry**
🥨 tendo — 🔵🔨➕🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary loading | Functional | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 3–4 min between sets.

**A. ➕ Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm)**
Log: weight (kg or lb) × distance (m) per side.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 30m each side
  (shoulder level, don't hike the hip, look straight ahead)
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 30m each side
  (if the pattern holds, keep the weight — if not, log what broke)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 30m each side
  (you should feel the oblique on the opposite side of the weight)
- Set 4: ⛽ 85% × 25m each side
  (reduce distance slightly at top load to preserve quality)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Single-Arm Overhead Carry (Anti-Rotation)**
Log: weight × distance per side.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 20m each side
  (ribs closed, don't let the overhead arm pull the ribcage open)
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 20m each side
  (breathe through the nose — holding breath collapses the overhead position)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 20m each side
  (note: the weaker side breaks at the shoulder first — record it)
- Set 4: ⛽ 85% × 15m each side
  (reduced distance at top load — the distance is the rep count, control it)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🥨 tendo — 🔵🔨➕🧩 (Supplemental | Anti-rotation + rotational power | Functional | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 2–3 min between sets.

**A. ➕ Split-Stance Pallof Press**
This is anti-rotation under strength demand. Treat it like a pressing strength exercise, not a corrective.

- Set 1: ⛽ 5 reps each side — moderate cable load
  (pause 2 sec at full extension, slow return — the resist matters more than the press)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 reps each side — same or slightly heavier
  (increase cable load only if the hips stay square and the torso doesn't rotate)
- Set 3: ⛽ 6 reps each side
  (6 reps is the ⛽ ceiling — stay there, add load before adding reps)

Rest: 2 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Wood Chop (Cable High-to-Low)**
Rotational power, unilateral, standing. Diagonal force production.

- Set 1: ⛽ 5 reps each side — moderate cable load
  (hips rotate with the trunk — the power comes from the hips, not the arms)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 reps each side
  (accelerate through the chop — decelerate the return — the eccentric is the training)
- Set 3: ⛽ 6 reps each side
  (both feet planted — if the feet move, the core is losing the fight)

Rest: 2 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE
🔵🔨➕🪫 (Release | Stress out | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 5 min

The carry and chop sessions create thoracic and oblique fatigue. The release targets the posterior chain and lateral line.

├─ 60 sec: QL Stretch (Side-Lying) — 30 sec each side
│  (pull the top knee toward chest, let the spine open laterally)
├─ 60 sec: Supine Spinal Twist — 30 sec each side
│  (the shoulder stays down — don't chase the rotation with the shoulder)
├─ 60 sec: Child's Pose (Core Release) — arms wide
│  (breathe into the lower back, not the chest)
└─ 2 min: Foam Roll Obliques — roll slowly side to side, 5–7 passes per side
   (pause on dense spots, breathe through them)

Rest: None.

## 🧮 SAVE

Distance and weight are both variables. When you can increase weight without losing distance, the carry is getting stronger. When distance drops before weight climbs, the base is not ready for the load. The log tells you which is happening.
