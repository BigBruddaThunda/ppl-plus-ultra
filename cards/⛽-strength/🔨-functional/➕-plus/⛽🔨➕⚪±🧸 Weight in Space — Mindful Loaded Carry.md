# ➕ Weight in Space — Mindful Loaded Carry ➕

Mindful loaded carry | Full-body power, core stability | 65–75 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➕⚪

> "The weight reveals the body only when you are quiet enough to hear it."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
⚪🔨➕♨️ (Warm-Up | Slow tissue prep | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 12 min

⚪ warm-ups are extended. The nervous system enters slowly.

├─ 3 min: Diaphragmatic Breathing (TVA Engagement)
│  ├─ Lying on back, knees bent, hands on belly
│  ├─ 4 sec inhale through nose — belly rises, chest stays still
│  ├─ Hold 2 sec
│  ├─ 6 sec exhale through nose — belly falls, feel the TVA engage
│  └─ Continue for 3 min — this is the bracing system you will use throughout
│
├─ 2 min: Cat-Cow (Core Mobility) — slow, 4 sec per direction
│  (full exhale at cat, full inhale at cow — breath drives the movement)
│
├─ 2 min: Dead Bug — 4 reps each side, 5 sec lowering
│  (the slowest version of this exercise — the TVA must hold through the entire descent)
│  (if the low back lifts, shorten the range — don't force it)
│
├─ 2 min: Bird Dog Hold × 5 sec per position × 4 each side
│  (slow extension, pause at the top, breathe through the hold)
│
└─ 3 min: Suitcase hold (very light) × 30 sec each side + Overhead Hold (Isometric) × 20 sec each side
   (listen to the body: where is the compensation? where does the shoulder creep up? where does the hip tilt?)
   (this is diagnostic before loading)

Rest: None — slow, continuous movement throughout warm-up.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — ⚪🔨➕▶️ (Primer | Breath-led activation | Functional | Tier 0–2)

Duration: 8 min

The primer in a mindful session is about connecting breath to bracing before load arrives.

├─ **A. Pallof Hold (Isometric) × 20 sec each side × 3 rounds**
│  ├─ Light cable, arms extended, hold
│  │  (breathe through the hold — don't hold your breath to brace)
│  │  (the exhale tightens the brace; the inhale must not break it)
│  └─ Rest 90 sec between sides
│
└─ **B. Single-Arm Farmer's Carry × 20m each side — 50% working weight**
   ├─ 2 trips each side
   │  (slow walking pace — take 2 sec per step, feel each foot contact)
   │  (the carry at slow pace teaches the hip stabilizer system differently than fast carries)
   └─ Rest 90 sec between sides

Rest: 90 sec between all primer exercises.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
🧸 fero — ⚪🔨➕🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary loading | Functional | Tier 0–3)

Rest: 4 min between sets. ⚪ color demands extended rest throughout.

⚪ + ⛽ is not a contradiction — the load is genuine strength load, the approach is deliberate and breath-connected. Slow tempo applies to transitions and holds, not to the power expression of carries.

**A. ➕ Overhead Carry (Single Kettlebell)**
Primary demand: Overhead stability, thoracic extension, anti-extension, breath under load.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% effort × 25m each side — slow, deliberate pace
  (breathe continuously — 4 sec inhale, 6 sec exhale while walking)
  (the overhead arm should not require concentration after the first 5 steps — it should be locked)
- Set 2: ⛽ 75% effort × 25m each side
  (on the second trip, close your eyes for 5 steps — where does the compensation appear?)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% effort × 20m each side
  (heavier — the breath pattern is the first thing to break under load; keep it)
- Set 4: ⛽ 80% effort × 20m each side
  (final set: notice whether the dominant arm or non-dominant arm loses the overhead position first)

Rest: 4 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Turkish Get-Up (Full) — slow tempo**
Primary demand: Full-body integration, deliberate position finding, breath at each transition.

- Set 1: ⛽ Moderate KB × 2 each side — 10+ sec per position
  (this is Slow Turkish Get-Up — Section L #19)
  (pause at every major position: lying, elbow, hand, kneeling, standing — breathe at each)
  (the slow TGU takes 45–60 sec per rep — that is the correct duration)
- Set 2: ⛽ Same weight × 2 each side
  (10 sec at the sweep position — it is the hardest point to breathe through)
- Set 3: ⛽ Slightly heavier × 2 each side
  (heavier load, same tempo — if the tempo breaks, the weight is too heavy)
- Set 4: ⛽ Same weight × 3 each side
  (3 reps — add volume, not load, for the final set)

Note: 2–3 reps per side × 10+ sec per position per side = approximately 4–5 min working time per set. This is correct for ⚪ format.

Rest: 4 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🧸 fero — ⚪🔨➕🧩 (Supplemental | Breath-integrated anti-rotation | Functional | Tier 0–2)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**A. ➕ Pallof Press (Cable) — breath-led**
- Set 1: ⛽ 4 reps each side — slow, 4 sec press, 4 sec return
  (exhale through the press — don't hold breath to brace, breathe to brace)
  (4 reps at this tempo is approximately the same duration as 8 reps at normal speed)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 reps each side — same tempo
  (add load slightly if the breath pattern stayed intact throughout set 1)
- Set 3: ⛽ 5 reps each side
  (the test: can you maintain the exhale-to-brace pattern at higher load?)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Dead Bug — loaded, slow**
Section F #117: Weighted Dead Bug (Dumbbell).
- Set 1: ⛽ Light DB overhead × 5 each side — 5 sec lowering
  (arm and leg lower together — 5 sec — hold 2 sec at bottom — 3 sec return)
  (this is the anti-extension system at its most deliberate)
- Set 2: ⛽ Same × 5 each side
  (count the seconds — if you speed up, the TVA is losing the hold)
- Set 3: ⛽ Same × 6 each side
  (6 reps of 5-second lowering = 30 seconds of continuous anti-extension work per side)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🪫 RELEASE
⚪🔨➕🪫 (Release | Parasympathetic downregulation | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 10 min

⚪ release is not decompression from effort — it is a deliberate transition from sympathetic to parasympathetic state.

├─ 2 min: Diaphragmatic Breathing — same protocol as warm-up
│  (4 sec inhale, 2 sec hold, 6 sec exhale — nasal throughout)
│  (the heart rate will drop noticeably within 3–4 cycles)
│
├─ 2 min: Supine Spinal Twist — 60 sec each side
│  (no forcing — let gravity do the rotation, breathe through the hold)
│
├─ 2 min: Child's Pose (Core Release) — extended arms
│  (breathe into the lower back on every inhale — feel the lumbar expand)
│
├─ 2 min: QL Stretch (Side-Lying) — 60 sec each side
│  (the overhead carry and TGU load the QL laterally — give it time)
│
└─ 2 min: Foam Roll Hip Flexors — slow, 3 passes each side
   (the TGU mobilizes the hip flexors dynamically — the foam roll settles the tissue)

Rest: None — continuous, parasympathetic movement.

## 🧮 SAVE

The mindful carry session trains the nervous system to stay organized under load rather than bracing through held breath. That distinction matters when the load is heavy and the distance is long — the breath is the only system that sustains the carry from the inside.
