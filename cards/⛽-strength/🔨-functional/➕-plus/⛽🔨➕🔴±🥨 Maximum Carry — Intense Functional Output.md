# ➕ Maximum Carry — Intense Functional Output ➕

High-volume functional power | Full-body power, core stability | 70–80 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➕🔴

> "Load the unilateral system until it reveals what bilateral work was hiding."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🔴🔨➕♨️ (Warm-Up | Full prep | Functional | Tier 0–2)

Duration: 10 min

🔴 requires a thorough warm-up because volume is high and rest periods are compressed.

├─ 2 min: General movement — hip CARs, thoracic rotation, ankle circles
├─ 90 sec: Dead Bug — 8 slow reps each side
│  (this is not warm-up filler — the bracing pattern must be dialed before max load)
├─ 90 sec: Kettlebell Swing (Two-Hand) — light × 15 reps
│  (hip hinge pattern, build power progressively)
├─ 90 sec: Single-Arm Farmer's Carry × 20m each side — 50% working weight
│  (confirm shoulder pack and lateral tilt before load goes up)
└─ 90 sec: Hang Power Clean (Single-Arm — Dumbbell) — light × 3 each side
   (GOLD gate open — groove the catch position before the Primer ramp)

Rest: None in warm-up.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🥨 tendo — 🔴🔨➕▶️ (Primer | Load ramp | Functional | Tier 2–4)

Duration: 6 min

One working-weight warm-up set per exercise. Then into the main block.

├─ **A. Hang Power Clean (Single-Arm — Dumbbell) × 3 each side — 70% working weight**
│  (feel the triple extension — hips, knees, heels — before the load climbs)
│
└─ **B. Suitcase Carry × 20m each side — 70% working weight**
   (confirm pattern holds at sub-max before going full output)

Rest: 90 sec between primer exercises.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
🥨 tendo — 🔴🔨➕🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary loading | Functional | Tier 2–4)

Rest: 3 min between sets. 🔴 compresses rest but ⛽ demands CNS recovery — 3 min is the floor.

**A. ➕ Hang Power Clean (Single-Arm — Dumbbell) — GOLD**
Section J #13 derivative. Triple extension, unilateral power.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 5 each side
  (aggressive hip drive, elbow punches under — this is the most reps you'll do at this weight)
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 5 each side
  (keep the elbow moving — the catch is the hardest part)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side
  (volume starts to stack CNS demand — stay sharp, don't grind)
- Set 4: ⛽ 85% × 4 each side
  (top weight — 4 reps is ceiling for this load at this fatigue state)
- Set 5: ⛽ 85% × 3 each side
  (fifth set at top weight — reps drop to maintain catch quality)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm) — superset with A where recovery allows**
Anti-lateral flexion under high volume.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 35m each side
  (loaded oblique endurance — the distance is the dose)
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 35m each side
  (hip doesn't hike — if it does, the weight is too heavy for this distance)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 35m each side
  (the third set is where the obliques talk — listen)
- Set 4: ⛽ 85% × 25m each side
  (top weight, reduced distance — precision under fatigue)
- Set 5: ⛽ 85% × 25m each side
  (same prescription as set 4 — this is the test of repeatability)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🥨 tendo — 🔴🔨➕🧩 (Supplemental | Rotational power — superset permitted | Functional | Tier 2–4)

Rest: 2 min between sets. 🔴 color — supersets authorized.

Superset: A + B back to back. The tissue alternation is sufficient for 🔴 format.

**Superset — A + B:**

**A. ➕ Wood Chop (Cable High-to-Low)**
Rotational power, unilateral, standing.
- Set 1: ⛽ 5 each side (immediate into B)
  (hips drive the rotation — the arms deliver, not generate)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 each side (immediate into B)
  (accelerate the chop, decelerate the return — eccentric loading matters)
- Set 3: ⛽ 6 each side (immediate into B)
  (top rep count for the session — stay aggressive)

**B. ➕ Renegade Row (Anti-Rotation)**
Superset partner — plank position, unilateral row, anti-rotation demand.
- Set 1: ⛽ 5 each side (after A, 2 min rest then next superset)
  (plank is the work — the row surfaces the weakness)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 each side
  (hips stay level — if they rotate, drop the weight)
- Set 3: ⛽ 6 each side
  (the cumulative fatigue from carries makes this harder than it looks)

Rest: 2 min after each superset round.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🌋 GUTTER
🥨 tendo — 🔴🔨➕🌋 (Gutter | All-out single effort | Functional | Tier 2–3)

One set. Maximum effort. Non-repeatable output.

🌋 context in 🔴: cathartic discharge — the last thing in the tank.

**➕ Single-Arm Farmer's Carry — max weight, max distance**
- 1 set × max distance per side — heaviest weight you can control
  (walk until form breaks — mark the distance, note the failure mode)
  (the Gutter is not a conditioning finisher — it is the honest ceiling of today's carry capacity)

Coaching note: The failure mode is data. Does the hip hike first? Does the shoulder drop? Does the walking pace collapse? Record what broke and when. That is the training prescription for the next session.

Rest: 3 min before Release.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 6. 🪫 RELEASE
🔴🔨➕🪫 (Release | Stress out | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 6 min

🔴 release = cathartic discharge. Tension out, not held.

├─ 90 sec: Foam Roll Obliques — slow, side to side
│  (5–7 passes per side, pause on dense spots)
├─ 90 sec: QL Stretch (Side-Lying) — 45 sec each side
│  (the QL took the most from the carries — give it time)
├─ 60 sec: Supine Spinal Twist — 30 sec each side
│  (derotation after all the chop and anti-rotation work)
└─ 2 min: Child's Pose (Core Release) + slow nasal breathing
   (not a stretch — a system reset)

Rest: None.

## 7. 🚂 JUNCTION
🥨 tendo — 🔴🔨➕🚂 (Junction | Transfer + session log | Functional | Tier 2–4)

Cross-Junction map:

```text
               ↑ ⛽🔨🛒🔴
                    (push — intense overhead carry transfers directly to max pressing)

← ⛽🔨🍗🔴   •   ⛽🔨➕🔴   → ⛽🔨🪡🔴
  (legs: the hip extension in the clean loads the leg system)    (pull: intense row and hinge work at same CNS demand)

               ↓ 🖼⌛➖🔴
                    (active recovery at intensity — flush the CNS, not add to it)
```

```
Date: ___________
DB Hang Power Clean — peak weight: ______ | total reps each side: ______
Suitcase carry — peak weight: ______ | peak distance: ______ m
Wood chop load: ______ | Renegade Row weight: ______
Gutter carry — weight: ______ | distance L: ______ m | R: ______ m
Failure mode (Gutter): ___________________________
Readiness next session (1–5): _________
```

- ⛽🔨➕🟣 — technical precision after intense volume — refine what the load exposed
- ⛽🔨🪡🔴 — the pull side at the same intensity, same session architecture
- 🖼⌛➖🔴 — necessary recovery after this CNS load

## 🧮 SAVE

High-volume carry sessions produce data that gym lifts cannot — asymmetry, gait collapse, hip instability under sustained unilateral load. The Gutter distance is the most honest number in the log. Track it across sessions.
