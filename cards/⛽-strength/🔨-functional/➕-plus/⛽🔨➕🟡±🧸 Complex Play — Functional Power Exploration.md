# ➕ Complex Play — Functional Power Exploration ➕

Exploratory functional power | Full-body power, core stability | 60–70 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➕🟡

> "Train the patterns you don't usually train. The ones that feel awkward are the ones that matter."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🟡🔨➕♨️ (Warm-Up | Playful movement prep | Functional | Tier 0)

Duration: 8 min

🟡 warm-ups are permissive — move freely, explore range, find the edges.

├─ 2 min: Free movement — hip circles, arm swings, walking lunges with rotation, lateral shuffles
│  (no prescription — move in the ways that feel stiff, open them up)
├─ 60 sec: Bear Crawl — forward, backward, sideways
│  (explore directions — you don't have to go straight)
├─ 60 sec: Dead Bug variations — try alternating arms only, alternating legs only, then full pattern
│  (find what your TVA can maintain)
├─ 60 sec: Kettlebell figure-8 — light KB, through the legs
│  (loose hips, feel the lateral load)
└─ 2 min: Turkish Get-Up (Full) — bodyweight × 1 each side
   (slow, deliberate — the get-up is a full body map)
   (pause at each position and notice what is working)

Rest: None — continuous warm-up.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — 🟡🔨➕▶️ (Primer | Pattern activation | Functional | Tier 2)

Duration: 6 min

The primer in a fun session should feel like play with purpose.

├─ **A. Swing + Clean Combo (Kettlebell) × 5 each side**
│  ├─ Section L #11: Swing + Clean (Combo)
│  ├─ 2 rounds each side — light KB
│  │  (the swing builds the hip hinge, the clean tests the redirect — one continuous motion)
│  └─ Rest 60 sec between sides
│
└─ **B. Landmine Rainbow × 8 each side**
   ├─ Section F #70: Landmine Rainbow
   ├─ 2 sets — light landmine plate
   │  (standing, arc the weight from hip to hip — feel the diagonal rotational demand)
   └─ Rest 60 sec between sets

Rest: 60 sec between exercises.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
🧸 fero — 🟡🔨➕🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary loading | Functional | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 3–4 min between sets.

The Bread & Butter in a 🟡 session still carries ⛽ load — the fun is in the variety of movement, not a reduction in demand.

**A. ➕ Turkish Get-Up (Full)**
Section F #211. Full-body integration, the flagship of functional power.

- Set 1: ⛽ Moderate KB × 3 each side
  (this is not a warm-up TGU — the KB should be heavy enough to demand bracing at every transition)
  (pause at the sweep-to-kneeling moment — it is the most technically demanding)
- Set 2: ⛽ Heavier KB × 3 each side
  (heavier than set 1 — test where the pattern wants to break)
- Set 3: ⛽ Same weight × 4 each side
  (4 reps at this weight — it is the ceiling for quality on this load)
- Set 4: ⛽ Heaviest manageable × 3 each side
  (top weight — 3 reps only, make each one deliberate)

Note: Load is relative. "Heavy" means heavy for TGU, which is typically lower than your other lifts. The full TGU with genuine load is a ⛽ effort.

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Kettlebell Snatch (Single-Arm)**
Section L #33. Non-GOLD (kettlebell snatch is not GOLD-gated unless oly-style barbell intent).
Unilateral, overhead, hip extension.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 4 each side
  (hike from between legs, hip snap, punch overhead — one fluid movement)
  (the arm should not muscle the bell up — the bell floats on the hip power)
- Set 2: ⛽ 75% × 4 each side
  (confirm the lockout — shoulder packed, elbow locked, tricep by ear)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side
  (heavier bell — the hip snap must be more aggressive, not the arm)
- Set 4: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side
  (same prescription — repeatability at this load is the goal)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🏖 SANDBOX
🧸 fero — 🟡🔨➕🏖 (Sandbox | Constrained exploration | Functional | Tier 0–3)

Duration: 15 min

This is structured play. The constraint: stay in ➕ Plus functional territory. The freedom: choose the exercises, the combinations, the movement vocabulary. Options below.

**The constraint:** All sandbox work must be:
- Unilateral or rotational or carry-based
- Within ⛽ load parameters (don't go light as a rest — this is still strength work)
- From Section F (Core), Section L (Kettlebell), or functional carry variants

**Sandbox options — pick 2–3, play with them for 15 min total:**

├─ **Option A: Swing to High Pull (L #10)** — explore what happens when the high pull stays unilateral
│  (how high can you pull the bell before the shoulder takes over from the hips?)
│
├─ **Option B: Mixed Carry (Rack + Overhead) (L #28)** — one arm in rack, other arm overhead
│  (asymmetric demand — the body has to stabilize two different overhead positions simultaneously)
│
├─ **Option C: Offset Farmer's Carry (F #143)** — different weights in each hand
│  (what does the asymmetric load do to your gait?)
│
├─ **Option D: Landmine Rainbow (F #70)** — full weight now, working load
│  (diagonal arc strength — both directions, note which side is stronger)
│
└─ **Option E: Kettlebell Windmill (L #54)** — if mobility allows
   (shoulder overhead, hinge to the floor — this is the Functional axis at its most demanding)
   (start light, never force the bottom position)

Coaching note: The sandbox is not a throwaway block. Discoveries made here are valid programming data. If something feels strong and unlocked, note it. If something exposes a gap, note it. This is how the system learns you.

Rest: Self-directed. Within ⛽ parameters, take 2–3 min between hard sets.

## 5. 🚂 JUNCTION
🧸 fero — 🟡🔨➕🚂 (Junction | Transfer + session log | Functional | Tier 0–3)

Cross-Junction map:

```text
               ↑ ⛽🔨🛒🟡
                    (push — TGU and snatch build the overhead base for pressing)

← ⛽🔨🍗🟡   •   ⛽🔨➕🟡   → ⛽🔨🪡🟡
  (legs: kettlebell squat and lunge exploration)    (pull: swing and snatch have a strong pull component)

               ↓ 🖼⌛➖🟡
                    (fun active recovery — movement exploration at restoration pace)
```

```
Date: ___________
TGU peak weight: ______ each side | Heaviest set: ______
KB Snatch peak weight: ______ each side
Sandbox choices: ___________________________
Sandbox discovery: ___________________________
Readiness next session (1–5): _________
```

Next →
- ⛽🔨➕🟣 — take the KB snatch into technical precision work with heavier load
- ⛽🔨🛒🟡 — the overhead position from TGU + snatch transfers directly to pressing exploration
- ⛽🔨➕🔵 — structure the best sandbox exercises into a repeatable protocol

## 🧮 SAVE

Variety sessions reveal which movements the body does not know. The Turkish Get-Up and the kettlebell snatch are each a complete dictionary of the body's coordination. What was difficult today is the training target for the next cycle.
