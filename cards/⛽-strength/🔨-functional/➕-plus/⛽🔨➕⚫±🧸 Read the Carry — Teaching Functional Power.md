# ➕ Read the Carry — Teaching Functional Power ➕

Loaded carry instruction | Full-body power, core stability | 65–75 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➕⚫

> "Understand what the weight is doing to your spine before you try to move fast with it."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
⚫🔨➕♨️ (Warm-Up | Core/Power prep | Functional | Tier 0–1)

Duration: 10 min

├─ 5 min general movement
│  ├─ 60 sec: Neck CARs (slow, full range, feel each position)
│  ├─ 60 sec: Thoracic rotation — hands behind head, seated on bench
│  ├─ 60 sec: Hip CARs — standing, one hand on wall
│  └─ 2 min: Dead Bug (slow, exhale on extension) — 8 reps each side
│     (breathe out, lower limbs slowly)
│
└─ 5 min carry-specific prep
   ├─ 60 sec: Shoulder blade squeeze + protraction — hands on wall, push floor away
   ├─ 60 sec: Rack position hold — kettlebell in rack, feel the difference in shoulder packing
   ├─ 60 sec: Suitcase hold — stand with one dumbbell, check lateral tilt in mirror
   └─ 2 min: Pallof Hold (Isometric) — cable at navel height, press and hold 5 sec per side × 5 rounds
      (rib cage down, don't let hips rotate)

Rest: None — this is movement prep.

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🧸 fero — ⚫🔨➕▶️ (Primer | Neural / pattern activation | Functional | Tier 2)

Duration: 8 min

The primer here is pattern recognition. Before you carry anything heavy, you carry something light and pay close attention.

├─ **A. Single-Arm Farmer's Carry (light — 50% of working weight)**
│  ├─ 2 trips × 20m each arm
│  │  (stand tall, pack the shoulder, don't hike the hip)
│  └─ Rest 60 sec between arms
│
└─ **B. Half-Kneeling Pallof Press**
   ├─ 2 sets × 8 reps each side — light cable, controlled
   │  (front knee in line with hip, back knee grounded, brace before you press)
   └─ Rest 60 sec between sides

Coaching note: The Pallof press here is not about reps — it is about feeling what anti-rotation actually means. The body learns the demand before it meets it at full load.

Rest: 60–90 sec between exercises.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 3. 🛠 CRAFT
🧸 fero — ⚫🔨➕🛠 (Craft | Skill acquisition, pattern teaching | Functional | Tier 2–3)

Duration: 18 min

This block exists solely to teach the movement. Load is kept sub-maximal. The goal is understanding, not output.

**Skill A: The Suitcase Carry — anti-lateral flexion**
├─ Coach's cue: Hold the weight in one hand. Do not lean away. The spine is vertical. The oblique on the opposite side is the primary worker.
│
├─ Drill 1: Suitcase hold, stationary — 30 sec each side, light KB
│  (feel the pull, resist it, ribcage stays level)
├─ Drill 2: Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm) × 20m each side — build to working weight
│  (don't rush the steps, slow feet teach the core)
└─ Rest: 90 sec between sides

**Skill B: The Overhead Carry — core compression under load**
├─ Coach's cue: The weight is not just in your hand. It is stacked through your wrist, elbow, shoulder, and into your spine. The ribcage stays closed. Nothing flares.
│
├─ Drill 1: Overhead Hold (Isometric) — KB overhead, 20 sec × 2 each side
│  (pack the shoulder, don't shrug, breathe into the belly)
├─ Drill 2: Overhead Carry (Single Kettlebell) × 15m each side — light
│  (slow steps, keep the elbow locked, gaze forward not at the weight)
└─ Rest: 90 sec between sides

**Skill C: The Pallof Press — anti-rotation under bracing demand**
├─ Coach's cue: The cable wants to pull you. Your only job is to stop it. The press is secondary. The resist is primary.
│
├─ Split-Stance Pallof Press × 10 reps each side — 2 sets
│  (exhale on press, hold 1 sec at extension, inhale on return)
└─ Rest: 90 sec between sides

Rest: Full 90 sec between all drills. This is a teaching block, not a conditioning block.

## 4. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
🧸 fero — ⚫🔨➕🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary loading | Functional | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 3–4 min between sets.

This is where the patterns from the Craft block meet genuine load. Weight goes up. Cues stay.

**A. ➕ Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm)**
Primary demand: Anti-lateral flexion. QL, obliques, hip stabilizers.

- Set 1: ⛽ 65% effort × 30m each side (light — confirm the pattern holds at load)
  (same spine as the drill, just heavier)
- Set 2: ⛽ 75% effort × 30m each side
  (no lateral tilt, shoulders level throughout)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% effort × 30m each side
  (this should feel like you're fighting it — that's the point)
- Set 4: ⛽ 80% effort × 30m each side
  (if the hip hikes, drop weight — form is the data here)

Load note: 65%/75%/80% refers to perceived maximum carry weight, not 1RM of any lift. Scale to what you can control.

Rest: 3 min between each set (each arm counts as one set).

**B. ➕ Overhead Carry (Single Kettlebell)**
Primary demand: Anti-extension, shoulder packing, thoracic stability.

- Set 1: ⛽ 65% effort × 20m each side
  (shoulder packed, elbow locked, eyes forward)
- Set 2: ⛽ 75% effort × 20m each side
  (feel the oblique, not the shoulder — if the shoulder takes over, the load is too heavy)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% effort × 20m each side
  (breathe while you walk — the brace is not a breath-hold)
- Set 4: ⛽ 80% effort × 20m each side
  (last set: note which side breaks first)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 5. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🧸 fero — ⚫🔨➕🧩 (Supplemental | Anti-rotation reinforcement | Functional | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 2–3 min between sets.

These exercises support the carry work by isolating the anti-rotation demand without locomotion.

**A. ➕ Split-Stance Pallof Press**
- Set 1: ⛽ 4 reps each side (slow press, 2 sec hold at extension, controlled return)
  (back knee soft, hips square, don't let the cable pull you open)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 reps each side
  (add 5–10% load from set 1 if the form was solid)
- Set 3: ⛽ 5 reps each side
  (note: reps are low because this is strength anti-rotation, not endurance)

Rest: 90 sec between sides, 2 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Renegade Row (Anti-Rotation)**
- Set 1: ⛽ 4 reps each side — moderate DB
  (plank position is the work — the row is secondary)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 reps each side
  (hips stay level, don't twist to pull — brace, then row)
- Set 3: ⛽ 5 reps each side
  (if the hips rotate, drop weight by one increment)

Rest: 2 min between sets.

Coaching note: The supplemental block is where you test whether the carry lessons transferred. If the pattern breaks on the Pallof press, the carry session is not yet in the body — that is information, not failure.

## 🧮 SAVE

Loaded carries are the most honest test of core function because the load is always trying to win. What you could not control today is the map for the next session. Log it precisely.
