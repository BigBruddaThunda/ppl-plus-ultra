# ➕ Clean Mechanics — Technical Single-Arm Power ➕

Technical Olympic derivatives | Full-body power, core stability | 65–75 min

CODE: ⛽🔨➕🟣

> "Each rep is a question. The weight answers whether your position was right."

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 1. ♨️ WARM-UP
🟣🔨➕♨️ (Warm-Up | Position prep | Functional | Tier 0–2)

Duration: 10 min

Technical colors require position awareness before load. This warm-up is deliberate.

├─ 2 min: Hip CARs × 5 each direction per side + Ankle circles × 10 each
│  (joint integrity before explosive demand)
├─ 90 sec: Dead Bug — 6 reps each side, slow exhale
│  (the bracing pattern here is the same bracing pattern in the clean catch)
├─ 90 sec: Kettlebell Swing (Two-Hand) — light × 10 reps
│  (hip hinge, not squat — the hinge is the engine for the clean)
├─ 2 min: Kettlebell Clean (Single) position drills — light
│  ├─ High pull from hang × 5 each side (find the path)
│  └─ Catch position hold × 5 sec per rep × 3 each side (rack position locked)
└─ 90 sec: Single-Arm Farmer's Carry × 15m each side — light
   (shoulder packed in rack position walk — the carry primes the catch)

Rest: None in warm-up.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 2. ▶️ PRIMER
🥨 tendo — 🟣🔨➕▶️ (Primer | CNS + position ramp | Functional | Tier 2–3)

Duration: 8 min

Work up to working weight across 3 progressively loaded sets. This is the ramp to technical precision.

├─ **A. Kettlebell Clean (Single) — positional ramp**
│  ├─ Round 1: Light × 3 each side — pause in catch 2 sec (feel the rack)
│  ├─ Round 2: Moderate × 3 each side — speed up the pull, maintain the pause
│  └─ Round 3: ~70% × 2 each side — approaching work weight
│     (the rack position must be solid before the load climbs)
│
└─ **B. Hang Power Clean — dumbbell, single-arm — positional ramp**
   ├─ GOLD exercise — 🟣 color gate is open
   ├─ Light × 3 each side — hang position above knee
   │  (the hips drive, the arm follows — the arm does not row the weight up)
   └─ Rest 60 sec between sides

Coaching note: The clean is a hinge with a redirect. The bar/bell rises because the hips extend violently, not because the arm pulls. Any session where this distinction is unclear is not a session for heavy load.

Rest: 90 sec between primer rounds.

## 3. 🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
🥨 tendo — 🟣🔨➕🧈 (Bread & Butter | Primary loading | Functional | Tier 2–5)

Rest: 4 min between sets. Technical color demands full recovery. Precision degrades under fatigue.

**A. ➕ Hang Power Clean (Single-Arm — Dumbbell)**
GOLD exercise. Section J #13: Single-Arm Dumbbell Clean derivative.
Primary demand: Triple extension, unilateral power, catch stability.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 4 each side
  (hang above knee, violent hip extension, punch the elbow under — the catch is the test)
  (if the elbow doesn't get under the weight, the hips didn't extend fully)
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side
  (same path every rep — the bell travels in a vertical line, not an arc)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 3 each side
  (reps drop at 80% to preserve precision — quality is the metric, not count)
- Set 4: ⛽ 85% × 3 each side
  (top weight, minimum reps — if rep 3 breaks, stop at 2)

Rest: 4 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Kettlebell Clean (Single)**
Section L #35. Complement to the dumbbell work — different feel in the rack.
Primary demand: Hip hinge power, rack position stability, forearm alignment.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 4 each side
  (dead stop between reps — no touch-and-go, each rep is its own attempt)
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 4 each side
  (the bell should not bang the forearm on the catch — if it does, the elbow came late)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 3 each side
  (3 reps at this weight — you're not training fatigue, you're training mechanics under load)
- Set 4: ⛽ 85% × 3 each side
  (the body remembers position, not effort)

Rest: 4 min between sets.

═══════════════════════════════════════

## 4. 🧩 SUPPLEMENTAL
🥨 tendo — 🟣🔨➕🧩 (Supplemental | Carry and anti-rotation reinforcement | Functional | Tier 2–3)

Rest: 3 min between sets. Technical color — no compression of rest periods.

The supplemental in a technical session supports the main lift mechanics, not a separate training goal.

**A. ➕ Suitcase Carry (Single-Arm)**
The carry reinforces the unilateral core demand that supports the clean catch.

- Set 1: ⛽ 75% × 30m each side
  (the clean requires anti-rotation at the catch — the carry trains it under duration)
- Set 2: ⛽ 80% × 25m each side
  (reduce distance at heavier load — precision of gait is the metric)
- Set 3: ⛽ 80% × 25m each side
  (note: which side's hip wants to hike — that is the side that struggles in the clean catch)

Rest: 3 min between sets.

**B. ➕ Half-Kneeling Pallof Press**
Targeted anti-rotation at the receiving position angle.

- Set 1: ⛽ 5 reps each side — moderate cable
  (front knee at 90 degrees, back knee grounded — brace, then press)
- Set 2: ⛽ 5 reps each side — add load if position was solid
  (2 sec hold at extension — feel the cable trying to rotate you)
- Set 3: ⛽ 6 reps each side
  (this is your ceiling — 6 reps of controlled anti-rotation under ⛽ parameters)

Rest: 2–3 min between sets.

## 🧮 SAVE

The clean is a precision test before it is a strength test. At ⛽ loads, the question is not whether you can lift it — it is whether you can lift it correctly. The catch position under heavy load is the only honest data point.
