  - operis-editions/historical-events/README.md — historical events database directory planted, 366-file spec, quality standards (NEW)
  - seeds/operis-architecture.md — 4 sections appended: pipeline reference, Layer 6 educational content, Color of the Day, 13-room Sandbox. Open questions updated. (UPDATED)
  - middle-math/rendering/operis-weight-derivation.md — Color of the Day scoring mechanism architecture: 7 input signals, resolution algorithm, confidence levels (UPDATED)
  - scl-deep/publication-standard.md — Color as Cognitive Posture Operis extension section added after Color Context Vernacular (UPDATED)
  - CLAUDE.md — seeds listing updated (4 new), operis-editions/ structure added, Operis Build-Out backlog section added, work streams table updated (UPDATED)
  - whiteboard.md — this session logged, Immediate Queue updated, Operis Build-Out backlog updated (UPDATED)
  - README.md — directory structure updated if needed (UPDATED)
Architecture notes:
  - 13-room Sandbox replaces variable 8–12 room selection. 8 Color siblings are deterministic. 5 Content Rooms are editorial.
  - Content Rooms translate Operis editorial content into physical practice (embodied cognitive learning). Content-to-zip mapping is the editor's craft.
  - Content Room titles follow ExRx naming convention — no editorial/narrative titles. Editorial connection lives in Operis prose, not card titles.
  - Color of the Day has three distinct identities documented: workout Color, publication Color, Operis cognitive posture.
  - Educational content lanes unified with Color Context Vernacular — each lane inherits its Color's tonal register.
  - Pipeline handoff contracts formalized: research brief, enriched content brief, Operis edition. Each is a defined markdown structure.
Next: Superseded by Sessions 029–030 and post-030 follow-up commits. Remaining work is Contract A/B URL enforcement + same-date re-test before returning to Deck 09.

### Session 029
Date: 2026-03-03
Work: Operis V4 Prompt Architecture — four generation prompts stored as seeds, pipeline aligned
Source: Claude.ai temp architect session (March 3, 2026)
Branch: claude/operis-v4-prompts-aIxIr
Output:
  - seeds/operis-researcher-prompt.md — Prompt 1: Researcher. Takes date → Research Brief (Contract A). Role definition, 5 research beats, historical events DB check, output format, V4.0 (NEW)
  - seeds/operis-content-architect-prompt.md — Prompt 2: Content Architect. Takes Research Brief → Enriched Content Brief (Contract B). Color of the Day determination (7 inputs), 8-lane assessment, Word of the Day, Content Room candidates, V4.0 (NEW)
  - seeds/operis-editor-prompt.md — Prompt 3: Editor. Takes both briefs → Operis Edition (Contract C). 8 Color siblings, 5 Content Rooms, Standing Departments, YAML front-matter spec, V4.0 (NEW)
  - seeds/operis-builder-prompt.md — Prompt 4: Builder. Takes edition → committed files. Proofing checklist (8 items), card generation procedure, repo commit, V4.0 (NEW)
  - seeds/operis-prompt-pipeline.md — Section header renamed to "Rotation Engine V1.0", Department Activation Matrix expanded to 17 departments (aligned with architecture), Prompt File Reference table added, Contract C updated with 13-room total, Automation Pathway references prompt seed paths, connects-to updated (UPDATED)
  - seeds/operis-sandbox-structure.md — Content Room Constraint Summary, Content-to-Zip Mapping Chain, and Naming Convention sections added. depends-on updated to include deck-identities/naming-convention.md (UPDATED)
  - seeds/operis-architecture.md — Generation Pipeline section updated with prompt file paths and 13-room confirmation, Standing Departments table aligned to 17 pipeline-matching department names, Rotation Engine V1.0 version note added, connects-to updated (UPDATED)
  - CLAUDE.md — 4 new prompt seed entries added to seeds/ listing, Operis Build-Out backlog updated (UPDATED)
  - whiteboard.md — Session 029 logged, Immediate Queue updated (UPDATED)
Next: Close remaining Contract A/B enforcement gaps (P1 URL+sky fields, P2 per-lane URLs), then re-run P1→P2→P3→P4 on 2024-07-26. After contract pass, continue Deck 09 identity → generation.

### Session 030
Date: 2026-03-04
Work: Operis V4 Pipeline Test — full date test (2024-07-26)
Status: PARTIAL PASS / CONTRACT FAIL

Passes:
- Color posture coherence (🔵 Structured) held across P2→P3.
- 13-room Sandbox mapping fidelity passed (8 siblings + 5 content rooms; Order lock + unique Type/Axis constraints satisfied).
- Department activation matrix behavior passed for Friday (🌾) active departments.

Failures:
- Contract A missing explicit source URLs per historical event and exact sky time fields.
- Contract B missing explicit source URLs per content lane.
- Contract C frontmatter key mismatch (`rooms` used instead of `sandbox-zips`) and missing `sandbox-total: 13`.

Artifacts:
- `operis-editions/test-results/2024-07-26/contract-a-research-brief.md`
- `operis-editions/test-results/2024-07-26/contract-b-content-brief.md`
- `operis-editions/test-results/2024-07-26/contract-c-operis-edition.md`
- `operis-editions/test-results/2024-07-26/pipeline-validation-report.md`

Completed since Session 030:
- ✅ Contract C frontmatter schema preflight (`sandbox-zips`, `sandbox-total`) and parser hardening landed (team refs: `8d730f9`; parser commit: `c024c37`).
- ✅ status allow-list alignment between schema + inventory docs/scripts landed (team refs: `b47b269`; alignment commit: `8f48ad5`).
- ✅ full-audit strict/baseline success-message clarification landed (`5369fff`).
- ✅ tree-notation validation hardening landed (`53f85f3`, `0fbf244`) and integrated with Contract C parsing (`c024c37`).

Open follow-ups:
1) Add strict URL + sky-field enforcement to P1 template/checklist (Contract A gap still open).
2) Add per-lane URL enforcement to P2 template/checklist (Contract B gap still open).
3) Re-run same date test after URL/schema patching.

### Session 031
Date: 2026-03-04
Work: Codex next-round handoff planner authored for container/job continuity
Branch: current active branch
Output:
  - .codex/NEXT-ROUND-HANDOFF.md — copy/paste brief capturing assumed-merged fixes, next task pack (A–D), definition of done, and kickoff prompt for next Codex run.
Notes:
  - Purpose is session-to-session continuity: prevent reopening closed loops and shift focus to container completion ledger + handoff closure evidence.
Next:
  - Execute Task A/B/C from `.codex/NEXT-ROUND-HANDOFF.md` in next active session.

### Session 032
Date: 2026-03-05
Work: Planted systems-eudaimonics seed and wired design-constraint references
Branch: current active branch
Output:
  - seeds/systems-eudaimonics.md — new economic philosophy seed (Eudaimonic alignment, EHI metric, longevity constraints, phase cost constraints, architecture mappings, open questions)
  - CLAUDE.md — DATA ETHICS POSITION section updated to reference systems-eudaimonics alongside data-ethics architecture
  - whiteboard.md — this session log entry
Notes:
  - Treated as constraint-layer architecture (no deliverable artifacts), aligned with requested Codex task instructions.
Next:
  - Use `seeds/systems-eudaimonics.md` as a required read when implementing Stripe/tier gates, bloom/vote/superscript context systems, notification UX, and Operis economics decisions.

### Session 033
Date: 2026-03-05
Work: CX-08 SQL schema materialization
Branch: current active branch
Output:
  - sql/001-create-exercise-library.sql
  - sql/002-create-exercise-families.sql
  - sql/003-create-user-ledger.sql
  - sql/004-create-user-profile.sql
  - sql/005-create-user-toggles.sql
  - sql/006-create-zip-metadata.sql
  - sql/007-populate-zip-metadata.sql
  - sql/README.md
Notes:
  - Materialized schema docs from middle-math/schemas into PostgreSQL 15+ migration files.
  - Included RLS policies with auth.uid(), triggers/functions, indexes, and zip_to_emoji().
  - Zip population script uses cross-join generate_series(1..7,1..6,1..5,1..8) for 1,680 rows.
Next:
  - Apply in Supabase in numeric order and validate against a live Postgres instance.
