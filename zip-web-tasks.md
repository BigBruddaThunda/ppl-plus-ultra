# ZIP Web Tasks

Source: handoff task list transcribed into auditable markdown checkboxes.

## Scaffold Tasks

- [ ] Create root ZIP Web map file and establish section skeleton.
- [ ] Define stable task-run workflow with two-file iteration rule.
- [ ] Add explicit auditable completion protocol (single checkbox flip per loop).

## Deck-Local Wiring

- [ ] Wire map entries to deck-local nodes and paths.
- [ ] Add deck-level neighbor references for immediate next-hop navigation.
- [ ] Confirm deck-local links are represented consistently in map content.

## Cross-Deck Intelligence

- [ ] Add cross-deck routing notes for progression, regression, and alternates.
- [ ] Capture edge intent so cross-deck links are explainable and reviewable.
- [ ] Ensure cross-deck paths preserve SCL constraints and directional logic.

## Validation

- [ ] Add validation pass criteria for link integrity and task-loop hygiene.
- [ ] Verify every iteration updates only `zip-web.md` + one task checkbox.
- [ ] Keep validation notes concise and attached to map evolution.

## Title Sync

- [ ] Keep map labels synchronized with canonical workout/card titles.
- [ ] Confirm naming consistency between zip codes and rendered map nodes.
- [ ] Final title audit after wiring and validation are complete.
