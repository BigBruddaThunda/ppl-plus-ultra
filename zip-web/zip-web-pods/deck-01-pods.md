# Deck 01 Pods — 🐂🏛 (Foundation × Basics)

**Status:** POPULATED — ZW-01
**Deck character:** Low CNS (1), bilateral/barbell bias, ≤65% load, 8–15 reps, 60–90s rest. Pattern learning at sub-maximal load.

Direction logic for 🐂🏛 hubs:
- **N (Progression):** Foundation grooved the pattern. N loads that pattern at strength level (⛽🏛) — mechanics are established, now apply real load.
- **E (Balance):** Bilateral stable work leaves unilateral gaps. 🐂🔨 (Foundation × Functional) fills those at matched intensity — same learning intent, unilateral plane.
- **S (Recovery):** Even low-CNS bilateral work benefits from a restorative or non-overlapping session. 🖼 Restoration or easy 🐂 conditioning keeps things moving without debt.
- **W (Exploration):** Foundation × Basics is the most predictable context in the system. W opens time-based, aesthetic, or integrated novelty that bilateral sub-maximal work never touches.

Type direction assignments:
- 🛒 Push hub → N=🪡 Pull, E=🍗 Legs, S=➖ Ultra, W=➕ Plus
- 🪡 Pull hub → N=🛒 Push, E=🍗 Legs, S=➖ Ultra, W=➕ Plus
- 🍗 Legs hub → N=➕ Plus, E=🪡 Pull, S=➖ Ultra, W=🛒 Push

| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🛒🔴 | Max-effort pressing follows high-density foundation power — the trainee is metabolically primed and upper body pressing at full output capitalizes on that readiness window. |
| E (Balance)     | 🐂🔨🪡🔵 | After high-density foundation power, E must drop density. Foundation functional structured pulling addresses the posterior chain gap at controlled pace. |
