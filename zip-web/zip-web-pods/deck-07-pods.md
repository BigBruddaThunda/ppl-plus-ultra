Fatigue Signature: CNS: 4 | Tissue: FullBody/Core/Power | Density: 4 | Character: Bilateral/Barbell/Stable

| Dir | Zip | Why |
|-----|-----|-----|
| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🛒🔴 | Max-effort pressing follows maximum power output — the trainee is at peak CNS readiness and heavy bilateral pressing capitalizes on that window. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡🔵 | After max-intensity power, E must drop density. Corrective structured pulling addresses the posterior chain gap without adding to the already-maxed CNS load. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🖼🌹➖⚪ | After maximum-density full-body power, the entire system needs genuine reset. Restoration conditioning at mindful pace is the only appropriate next session. |
| W (Exploration) | 🌾🌹🍗🟡 | Full body aesthetic leg exploration — playful, pump-focused, creative lower body work — is the maximum character inversion from max-intensity compound power. |

### ⛽🏛➕🟠±🤌 — Power Station Loop

Fatigue Signature: CNS: 4 | Tissue: FullBody/Core/Power | Density: 3 | Character: Bilateral/Barbell/Stable

| Dir | Zip | Why |
|-----|-----|-----|
| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🛒🟠 | Push circuit follows power station loop — the same station-rotation structure applied to bilateral pressing patterns, building upper body output from the power session's base. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡🔵 | Circuit power leaves the posterior chain and unilateral pulling unaddressed. Corrective structured pulling fills that gap at controlled density. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🖼🌹➖⚪ | Sustained power circuit generates systemic fatigue across all tissue groups. Restoration conditioning provides the somatic reset that full-body circuit effort demands. |
| W (Exploration) | 🦋🌹🍗🟡 | Hypertrophy aesthetic leg exploration is the deliberate character inversion — isolated, pump-focused, lower body only, playful vs. the station-based full-body power loop. |

| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🛒🟡 | Press variety follows complex play — the same exploratory intent applied to bilateral pressing patterns. You found new combinations in power; now find them in pressing. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡🟢 | Bodyweight corrective pulling is the accessible posterior chain balance — no equipment, functional, directly addresses what complex power play left unaddressed. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🐂🏛➖⚫ | Foundation conditioning at coaching pace keeps the body active without adding to the varied full-body CNS demand from complex play. |
| W (Exploration) | 🌾🌹🍗🟡 | Full body aesthetic leg exploration opens the playful lower body vector — creative leg work in an integrated context, opposite of exploratory full-body power patterns. |

Fatigue Signature: CNS: 4 | Tissue: FullBody/Core/Power | Density: 1 | Character: Bilateral/Barbell/Stable

| Dir | Zip | Why |
|-----|-----|-----|
| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🛒⚪ | Heavy slow press extends the deliberate tension character into bilateral pressing — same 4-second eccentrics, same extended rest, the natural upper body continuation. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡⚪ | Mindful corrective pulling applies slow-tempo single-arm work to the upper back gap — the deliberate pace transfers directly from mindful power patterns. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🖼🌹➖⚪ | Mindful power flows naturally into restoration conditioning — both are breath-centered and somatic. The transition costs nothing in terms of accumulated fatigue. |
| W (Exploration) | 🐂🌹🍗⚫ | Foundation aesthetic legs at teaching pace inverts the character entirely — instead of slow composite power, you're learning isolated lower body mechanics with aesthetic attention. |

### ⛽🏛➖⚫±📍 — The Mechanics of Hard Effort

Fatigue Signature: CNS: 4 | Tissue: Cardiovascular | Density: 1 | Character: Bilateral/Barbell/Stable

| Dir | Zip | Why |
|-----|-----|-----|
| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🍗⚫ | The squat lesson follows conditioning mechanics teaching — lower body strength learning builds on the base cardiovascular output the conditioning session prepared. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡⚫ | After conditioning's cardiovascular demand, the upper back and unilateral pulling patterns are absent. Corrective functional pulling at teaching pace addresses the muscular gap. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🐂🏛🛒⚫ | Foundation pressing at coaching pace is an appropriate recovery push — very low CNS ceiling, pattern-learning intent, nothing that competes with the conditioning effort. |
| W (Exploration) | 🌾⌛➕🟣 | Time-based full body power is the complete character shift from linear conditioning mechanics — different clock structure, explosive intent, composite movement integration. |

| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🍗🟢 | Bodyweight leg strength follows outdoor conditioning — functional lower body progressions build on the cardiovascular base without requiring equipment. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡🟢 | Bodyweight corrective pulling balances the cardiovascular session's neglect of upper muscular pulling — functional, accessible, no equipment barrier. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🐂🏛🛒🟢 | Bodyweight foundation pressing is low-CNS recovery output — the pressing patterns are straightforward and the load is minimal after outdoor conditioning. |
| W (Exploration) | 🌾🔨➕🟣 | Functional full body power with technical precision opens the athletic composite vector that outdoor conditioning never accesses — explosive, ground-based, integrated. |

|-----|-----|-----|
| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🍗🔵 | Standard leg day builds on the cardiovascular and structural foundation that structured conditioning sessions create — strength lower body follows conditioning naturally. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡🔵 | After conditioning's cardiovascular demand, upper body pulling is entirely neglected. Corrective structured functional pulling fills the muscular gap at appropriate density. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🐂🏛🛒⚫ | Foundation pressing at coaching pace is an easy recovery push — low CNS ceiling, pattern-learning intent, no additional cardiovascular demand. |
| W (Exploration) | 🌾⌛➕🟣 | Time-based full body power opens the explosive power vector that structured interval conditioning never touches — integration, athleticism, different clock logic. |

| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🍗🟣 | Technical leg mechanics follow precision conditioning — the quality focus extends from output precision to bilateral squat mechanics at the same extended-rest standard. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡🟣 | Technical corrective pulling applies precision to the upper back gap — single-arm and unilateral pulling that conditioning precision work never addressed. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🐂🏛🛒⚫ | Foundation pressing at coaching pace is the appropriate recovery push after precision conditioning — low load, mechanical focus, no cardiovascular demand. |
| W (Exploration) | 🦋🌹➕🟣 | Hypertrophy aesthetic power and core opens a completely different training intent — pump, feel, isolation lens applied to composite movement, opposite of precision output work. |

Fatigue Signature: CNS: 4 | Tissue: Cardiovascular | Density: 4 | Character: Bilateral/Barbell/Stable

| Dir | Zip | Why |
|-----|-----|-----|
| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🍗🔴 | Heavy leg day follows maximum conditioning — the lower body strength session capitalizes on the cardiovascular priming that max-intensity conditioning creates. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡🔵 | After max-intensity conditioning, E must drop density. Corrective structured pulling fills the upper body muscular gap without compounding cardiovascular fatigue. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🖼🌹🛒⚪ | After maximum-density conditioning, restoration pressing is the lightest possible upper body session — somatic, minimal load, leaves fresher than entered. |
| W (Exploration) | 🌾⌛➕🟣 | Time-based full body power is a completely different character — structured intervals with power output vs maximum sustained conditioning effort. Different clock, different intent. |

| N (Progression) | ⛽🏛🍗🟠 | Leg station loop follows circuit conditioning — the same rotation format applied to compound lower body patterns, building on the metabolic base. |
| E (Balance)     | ⚖🔨🪡🔵 | Circuit conditioning rarely addresses upper muscular pulling properly. Corrective structured functional pulling fills the upper back gap at controlled density. |
| S (Recovery)    | 🐂🏛🛒⚫ | Foundation pressing at coaching pace is easy recovery output — very low CNS ceiling, mechanical focus, no cardiovascular competition after circuit conditioning. |
| W (Exploration) | 🦋🪐➕🟣 | Hypertrophy challenge power is the deliberate inversion — focused, heavy, single-exercise quality vs the station-based cardiovascular circuit. |
