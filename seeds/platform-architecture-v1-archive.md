  Architecture evolved significantly between Feb 11–25. Zip code system matured from
  formatting convention to full addressing architecture. 6-Axis navigation evolved from
  tab bar to spatial floor model (piano nobile). Daily system emerged as front page and
  onboarding layer. Elevator model resolved (4 dials = building/floor/wing/room). Business
  logic, database schema thinking, UX flows, and tech stack decisions preserved in V2
  (seeds/platform-architecture-v2.md). This document retained for historical reference.

🧮 Ppl± ITSELF
The Complete Platform Architecture — Context Document
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
**Document Type:** System Architecture & Context Capture
**Status:** 🟡 Draft / Living Document
**Created:** February 11, 2026
**Author:** Jake Berry
**Purpose:** Complete specification of Ppl± as a digital training platform
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# 🎯 INTENTION

"Ppl± is a mobile-first training platform that delivers Jake's seasonal athletic development system to clients through structured programs, daily workouts, and intelligent automation—while preserving the human craft of coaching."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 🐂 FOUNDATION — What Ppl± Is
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## The Core Concept

Ppl± is a digital training platform built around three interconnected systems:

1. **The Training System** — Ppl± methodology (Push/Pull/Legs/Plus), Seven Orders (seasonal training phases), Eight Colors (equipment/structure approaches)
2. **The Delivery Platform** — Mobile-first web application that delivers workouts, tracks progress, manages programs, and builds community
3. **The Business Model** — Tiered subscription service that scales from mass-market daily workouts to personalized training programs

## The Problem It Solves

**For Clients:**
- Workout programming is overwhelming and inconsistent
- Generic fitness apps don't account for seasons, climate, or life phases
- Progress tracking is fragmented across apps, notes, and memory
- Community and accountability are missing from solo training
- Quality coaching is expensive and geographically limited

**For Jake:**
- One-on-one training doesn't scale beyond hourly availability
- Remote clients need structured delivery beyond text messages
- Creating custom programs for each client is time-intensive
- Knowledge and methodology aren't systematized for reuse
- Revenue is capped by physical training hours

## The Solution Architecture

Ppl± solves both sides through:

**Structured Delivery:**
- Workouts formatted in Ppl± Semantic Compression Language (SCL)
- Mobile-optimized for portrait mode (screenshot-friendly)
- Clear visual hierarchy using emojis as semantic anchors
- Programs structured as "card decks" (collections of workouts)

**Intelligent Scaling:**
- Daily workouts for mass market (Tier 1: $10/month)
- Personal programs for dedicated clients (Tier 2: $25/month)
- Automation pathway using RAG to reduce Jake's manual work
- Community layer for support and accountability

**Data Ownership:**
- Users build personal workout libraries via 🧮 SAVE tagging
- Programs stored as "chapters" they can return to
- Training history becomes a personal almanac
- Random workout generator pulls from their saved collection

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# 🏛 ARCHITECTURE — The 6-Axis Navigation System
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Ppl± uses the six axes from SCL as the primary navigation structure. Each axis is a top-level section containing related features and functions.

## Visual Structure

```
Top Navigation (Mobile: Bottom Tab Bar)
├─ 🏛 Firmitas (Home/Foundation)
├─ 🔨 Utilitas (Tools/Settings)
├─ 🌹 Venustas (Progress/Vanity)
├─ 🪐 Gravitas (Content/Challenges)
├─ ⌛ Temporitas (Calendar/Time)
└─ 🐬 Sociatas (Community/Social)
```

Each axis asks a fundamental question and contains features that answer it.

# 🗿 USER EXPERIENCE — The Card Deck Metaphor
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Core Metaphor: Workouts as Cards, Programs as Decks

**Mental Model:**
```
Workout = Card (individual training session)
Program = Deck (collection of cards in sequence)
🧮 SAVE = Add card to personal collection
Saved Library = Your card collection
Random Generator = Shuffle & draw from collection
```

This metaphor shapes the entire UX:
- Users "collect" workouts they love
- Programs are "chapters" they can return to
- History becomes an "almanac" of past training
- Variety comes from "drawing" random cards

  // 2. Apply type filters
  pool = pool.filter(w => filters.types.includes(w.type_emoji));

  // 3. Exclude recent workouts
  const cutoffDate = new Date();
  cutoffDate.setDate(cutoffDate.getDate() - filters.excludeDays);
  pool = pool.filter(w => w.last_done < cutoffDate || !w.last_done);

  // 4. Remove duplicates
  pool = [...new Set(pool.map(w => w.workout_id))];

  // 5. Random selection
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * pool.length);
  return pool[randomIndex];

## Mobile-First Design Constraints

### Screen Size:
- **Portrait mode only** (for now)
- Width: 375-430px (iPhone SE to iPhone Pro Max)
- Height: Variable (scrollable content)

### Typography:
- Base font: 14px (readable without zoom)
- Headers: 18-24px (clear hierarchy)
- Emojis: 1.2em (larger than text, visually distinct)
- Monospace for workouts: Preserves tree connectors

### Layout:
- Single column (no side-by-side content)
- Bottom tab navigation (6 axes, always visible)
- Minimal chrome (maximize content space)
- Progressive disclosure (collapse sections by default)

### Screenshot Mode:
```css
@media print, .screenshot-mode {
  /* Hide all UI chrome */
  nav, .tab-bar, .back-button, .log-button {
    display: none;
  }

  /* Clean borders for screenshot */
  .workout-container {
    border: 2px solid #000;
    padding: 1rem;
  }

  /* Ensure tree connectors render */
  .workout-content {
    font-family: 'SF Mono', Consolas, monospace;
    white-space: pre-wrap;
  }
}
```

### Logging Interface (Progressive Disclosure):

**Initial View:**
```
Workout displays in full-screen, read-only mode.
[Do This Workout]  [Screenshot] [🧮 Save]
```

**User Taps "Do This Workout":**
```
Same workout, now with input fields inline:
🧈 BREAD & BUTTER
├─ Barbell Back Squat — 4 sets:
│   Set 1: 🐂 70% × 5  [__kg] × [__reps] ✓
│   Set 2: 🐂 75% × 4  [__kg] × [__reps] ✓
│   Set 3: ⛽ 82% × 3  [__kg] × [__reps] ✓
│   Set 4: ⛽ 85% × 3  [__kg] × [__reps] ✓
[Submit & Next Exercise]
```

Logging happens exercise-by-exercise, not all at once (reduces cognitive load).

## API Structure

### Authentication:
```typescript
// Supabase handles auth
// Sign up
const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password'
});

// Sign in
const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'password'
});
```

### Fetching Workouts:
```typescript
// Get today's daily workout
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('workouts')
  .select('*')
  .eq('is_daily', true)
  .eq('published_date', new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0])
  .single();

// Get user's assigned program
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('user_programs')
  .select(`
    *,
    program:programs(*),
    program_workouts(
      *,
      workout:workouts(*)
    )
  `)
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .eq('status', 'active')
  .single();
```

### Logging a Workout:
```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('workout_logs')
  .insert({
    user_id: userId,
    workout_id: workoutId,
    user_program_id: userProgramId, // NULL if not from program
    completed_date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
    exercises_logged: {
      "Barbell Back Squat": {
        sets: [
          { weight: 100, reps: 5 },
          { weight: 107, reps: 4 },
          { weight: 117, reps: 3 },
          { weight: 121, reps: 3 }
        ]
      }
    },
    overall_rating: 9,
    notes: "Felt strong today, depth was good",
    saved: true // User checked 🧮 SAVE
  });
```

### Random Workout Generation:
```typescript
// Server-side function (Next.js API route)
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { userId, filters } = req.body;

  // Get saved workouts
  const { data: saved } = await supabase
    .from('saved_workouts')
    .select('workout_id')
    .eq('user_id', userId);

  // Get completed workouts (if opted in)
  const { data: completed } = await supabase
    .from('workout_logs')
    .select('workout_id')
    .eq('user_id', userId);

  // Combine pools
  let pool = [...saved.map(s => s.workout_id), ...completed.map(c => c.workout_id)];

  // Remove duplicates
  pool = [...new Set(pool)];

  // Fetch full workout data
  const { data: workouts } = await supabase
    .from('workouts')
    .select('*')
    .in('id', pool);

  // Apply type filters
  let filtered = workouts.filter(w =>
    filters.types.includes(w.type_emoji)
  );

  // Random selection
  const random = filtered[Math.floor(Math.random() * filtered.length)];

  res.json({ workout: random });
}
```

# 🪜 AUTOMATION PATHWAY — The RAG Integration
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## The Goal: Jake's Time Investment Decreases as User Base Grows

**Current State (Manual):**
- 100 users = 10 hours/week
- 500 users = 50 hours/week (unsustainable)

**Future State (Automated):**
- 100 users = 10 hours/week
- 500 users = 15 hours/week (RAG handles most)
- 1000 users = 20 hours/week (still manageable)

---

## Phase 1: Manual Operation (Months 1-3)

**Jake's Workflow:**

**Daily:**
- Write 1 daily workout (what Jake is training)
- Post to platform (10 minutes)

**Weekly:**
- Review Tier 2 client logs (10 min × 10 clients = 100 min)
- Assign next week's workouts (15 min × 10 clients = 150 min)
- Respond to DMs (5 min × 10 clients = 50 min)
- Forum engagement (30 min)

**Total: ~6-8 hours/week**

---

## Phase 2: Assisted (Months 4-6)

**RAG Integration Begins:**

### RAG Training Data:
- All workouts Jake has written (SCL formatted)
- Jake's training logs (15,000+ hours documented)
- Client feedback (ratings, reviews)
- Forum Q&A (Jake's answers become training data)
- This context document (🧮 Ppl± Itself)

### RAG Capabilities:

**1. Daily Workout Suggestions**
```
RAG analyzes:
├─ Current Order (🦋 Ionic, Week 3)
├─ Recent daily workouts (last 7 days)
├─ Seasonal context (late winter, moderate temps)
├─ Climate data (South Carolina weather)
└─ Training patterns (Jake's typical Week 3 Ionic work)
RAG generates:
"Suggested daily workout for Feb 12, 2026:
🪡🗿🔴 Pull Sculpt Intense
Heavy pull work + hypertrophy finish. 75 min.
Would you like to review/edit before posting?"
```

**Jake's Workflow:**
- Review RAG suggestion (2 minutes)
- Edit if needed (5 minutes)
- Approve and post (1 minute)

**Time saved: 50%** (10 min → 5 min per day)

**2. Forum Auto-Responses**
```
User asks in #questions:
"How do I know if I'm ready for 🏟 Performance phase?"
RAG drafts response:
"Great question! You're ready for 🏟 Performance when:
- You've completed at least 4 weeks of 🦋 Hypertrophy
- Your technique is consistent under fatigue
- You want to test your current maximums
Jake recommends a deload week before testing. Would you like
me to suggest a deload protocol?"
[Jake: Approve] [Edit] [Reject]
```

Jake reviews before posting (saves 80% of time writing responses).

---

## Phase 3: Semi-Automated (Months 7-12)

### RAG Expands Capabilities:

**1. Tier 2 Program Suggestions**
```
RAG analyzes Sarah's logs:
├─ Completed "Summer Cut 2025" (8 weeks)
├─ PRs on all pull exercises
├─ Saved 9 pull workouts (favorites)
├─ Ratings: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ on high-volume back work
├─ Comments: "Love the deadlift variations"
└─ Goal: "Get stronger, maintain definition"
RAG suggests next program:
"🏟 Upper Body Strength Block (4 weeks)
Focus: Max strength in pull patterns
Frequency: 4×/week (Pull 2×, Push 1×, Legs 1×)
Week 1-2: Strength foundation (75-85% loads)
Week 3: Intensification (85-90% loads)
Week 4: Test week (90-100% loads)
This builds on Sarah's pull strength while maintaining
her cut physique. Approve to assign?"
[Jake: Approve] [Modify] [Create Custom Instead]
```

**Jake's Workflow:**
- Review RAG suggestion (3 minutes)
- Modify if needed (5 minutes)
- Approve and assign (1 minute)

**Time saved: 70%** (20 min → 6 min per client program)

**2. Smart Exercise Substitutions**
```
Client reports: "Gym doesn't have safety squat bar"
RAG suggests alternatives:
"Based on the workout's intent (quad emphasis, back-friendly):
1. Front Squat (same quad bias, less spinal load)
2. Goblet Squat (beginner-friendly, same pattern)
3. Leg Press (isolation, no barbell needed)
Which would you prefer? I'll adjust your program."
```

Client selects, RAG updates program automatically, Jake gets notification.

---

## Phase 4: Fully Automated (Year 2+)

### RAG Operates Autonomously (with Jake's Oversight)

**Daily Workflows:**

**1. Daily Workout Publishing (100% Automated)**
```
Every morning at 6:00 AM:
├─ RAG generates daily workout based on:
│   ├─ Current Order and week
│   ├─ Seasonal context
│   ├─ Recent workout patterns
│   └─ Climate data
├─ Formats in SCL (perfect structure)
├─ Posts to platform automatically
└─ Sends Jake notification: "Daily workout posted ✓"
Jake reviews later (5 min/day, asynchronous)
```

**2. Forum Moderation (90% Automated)**
```
User posts question → RAG responds immediately
User posts form check video → RAG tags Jake for review
User celebrates PR → RAG congratulates, suggests next challenge
Spam detected → RAG flags for moderation
Jake checks moderation queue 1×/day (15 min)
```

**3. Tier 2 Program Management (80% Automated)**
```
Weekly cycle (Sunday night):
├─ RAG reviews all Tier 2 client logs
├─ Generates next week's programs
├─ Sends drafts to Jake's admin panel
├─ Jake reviews/approves in batch (30 min for 50 clients)
└─ RAG assigns approved programs automatically
Clients wake up Monday with new week ready ✓
```

**Jake's Weekly Time Commitment at 500 Users:**
```
Daily workout review: 5 min × 7 = 35 min/week
Forum moderation: 15 min/day × 7 = 105 min/week
Tier 2 program approval: 30 min (batch review)
DM responses (flagged by RAG): 30 min/week
Content creation (essays, demos): 2 hours/week
Total: ~5 hours/week digital work
(Down from 50 hours/week without automation)
```

---

## What RAG Learns Over Time

**Training Data Sources:**

1. **Workout Library**
   - Every workout Jake writes (SCL structure)
   - Exercise selection patterns
   - Loading schemes by Order
   - Block combinations that work

2. **Client Feedback**
   - Workout ratings (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
   - Saved workouts (what clients love)
   - Written reviews (qualitative data)
   - Progress metrics (what produces results)

3. **Jake's Edits**
   - When Jake modifies RAG suggestions
   - Learn from corrections
   - Pattern recognition improves

4. **Forum Interactions**
   - Common questions (build FAQ automatically)
   - Jake's answers (learn his voice)
   - Community wisdom (what resonates)

5. **Seasonal Patterns**
   - South Carolina climate data
   - Historical workout archives
   - Order progressions across years

**Result:** RAG becomes Jake's digital apprentice, trained on 15,000+ hours of expertise.

# 🧬 IMPRINT — Core Principles
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Design Philosophy

**1. Mobile-First, Always**
- Desktop is a nice-to-have, not a requirement
- Portrait mode screenshot-friendly (workouts as image cards)
- Progressive Web App (offline capable, "add to home screen")

**2. SCL as the Semantic Foundation**
- Workouts formatted in Ppl± Semantic Compression Language
- Emojis aren't decoration—they're addresses
- ZIP codes create addressable, queryable content
- Consistency enables automation (RAG can parse structure)

**3. Card Deck Metaphor**
- Workouts = Cards (collect your favorites)
- Programs = Decks (structured sequences)
- 🧮 SAVE creates personal collection
- Random generator = shuffle & draw
- History = almanac of past training

**4. Tiered Access, Not Feature Walls**
- Tier 1 gets real value (daily workouts, community, tools)
- Tier 2 gets personalization (not locked features)
- Never: "Upgrade to see this"
- Always: "Upgrade for personal coaching"

**5. Automation Serves the Coach, Not Replaces**
- RAG generates drafts, Jake approves
- AI suggests, humans decide
- Technology scales craft, doesn't dilute it
- Jake's expertise remains the product

**6. Data Ownership**
- Users own their logs, photos, notes
- Export functionality (future feature)
- Privacy controls (choose what to share)
- No selling user data, ever

**7. Community as Accountability**
- Forum before DMs (public knowledge benefits all)
- Celebrate wins loudly (#wins channel)
- Support struggles quietly (DMs, moderation)
- No toxic positivity (honest training talk)

---

## Non-Negotiables

**Legal Compliance:**
- Terms of Service on signup (liability waiver)
- Clear disclaimers (informational use, not medical)
- Jake's PT insurance covers platform usage
- No medical claims, diagnosis, or treatment

**User Safety:**
- Emergency protocol visible in app
- "Stop if pain/dizziness" messaging
- Form checks flagged for Jake's review (not AI-diagnosed)
- Conservative recommendations (RAG biases safety)

**Content Quality:**
- No auto-publishing without Jake's review (Phase 1-3)
- Even automated RAG requires approval (Phase 4)
- Forum moderation (no spam, harassment, misinformation)
- Exercise demos verified for safety

**Financial Integrity:**
- Transparent pricing (no hidden fees)
- Easy cancellation (Stripe handles)
- Refund policy (pro-rated if unused)
- Lifetime access to paid content (Jake's anti-extraction philosophy)
