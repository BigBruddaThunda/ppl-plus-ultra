  Architecture evolved significantly between Feb 11–25. Zip code system matured from
  formatting convention to full addressing architecture. 6-Axis navigation evolved from
  tab bar to spatial floor model (piano nobile). Daily system emerged as front page and
  onboarding layer. Elevator model resolved (4 dials = building/floor/wing/room). Business
  logic, database schema thinking, UX flows, and tech stack decisions preserved in V2
  (seeds/platform-architecture-v2.md). This document retained for historical reference.
