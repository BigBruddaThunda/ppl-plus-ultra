# Seeds — PPL± Future Architecture

Seeds are architectural decisions and ideas that have been reviewed and approved but are not yet active work. They are not speculative. They are not to-do items. They are planted facts waiting for their phase.

**Do not act on seeds unless instructed.** Each seed becomes active when its phase is reached and Jake Berry confirms it is ready to build.

Seeds live here rather than in whiteboard.md because they have cleared the ideation threshold. They are real. They just aren't Phase 2 or 3.

## Seed Status Conventions

- **SEED** — Planted. Reviewed. Not yet active work.
- **GROWING** — Phase has arrived. Active development in progress.
- **HARVESTED** — Built and integrated. Seed file archived.

| 3+ | Validation layer | exercise-attribute-tagging.md |
| 4 | Design system + HTML scaffold | axis-as-app-floors.md, color-context-vernacular.md, art-direction.md, superposed-order-ui.md |
| 5 | Interactive HTML cards | axis-as-app-floors.md, zip-dial-navigation.md, exercise-superscript.md, superposed-order-ui.md, almanac-room-bloom.md |
| 6 | User accounts + Almanac | default-rotation-engine.md, almanac-macro-operators.md, junction-community.md, almanac-room-bloom.md |
