# The 4-Dial Lock — Zip Code Navigation

## One Sentence

A 4-dial combination lock spinner (Order → Axis → Type → Color) is the primary navigation for the entire app — spin to browse any of 1,680 rooms.

## The Concept

Four dials, left to right: [Order — 7 stops] [Axis — 6 stops] [Type — 5 stops] [Color — 8 stops]. Each is a thumb-scroll up/down. The dials spin independently. When you land on a combination, you see that room.

No menu hierarchy. No search bar. Four dials. The zip code IS the URL, the address, and the navigation input. The emoji changes as you scroll. The room behind it shifts in real-time — color wash changes, Order weight changes, content reshuffles.

This makes the system tactile and playful — aligned with the LEGO/abacus/retro aesthetic. Physical. Clicks into place. Each position has a satisfying stop.

## Dual Function of the Axis Dial

The Axis dial does double duty (see seeds/axis-as-app-floors.md). Inside a workout, spinning it changes exercise character. At the app level, spinning it changes which floor of the building you're standing on. The 4-dial lock lives on 🏛 Firmitas (the lobby). Spinning the Axis dial is like taking the elevator to a different floor.

## Open Questions

- Where does the dial live? Bottom of screen (thumb-accessible) or top (header)?
- Does spinning animate the background room change, or snap?
- Can you "lock" dials? (e.g., lock Order to ⛽ and only spin the other three)
- How does the dial interact with the Almanac? (Spinning to a non-Almanac zip = visiting vs. queuing?)
