🎯

"Conduct deep internet research for a single deck, producing a cosmogram — a culture, context, content, and almanac identity document — that becomes the DNA for every zip code room in that deck, without assuming any single thread of research constitutes the full scope of the idea space it feeds."

📍 pono — THE SYSTEM BRIEFING

Before searching, the researcher must hold the complete SCL-61 architecture in working memory. This section carries that architecture. It is dense by design. Read the entire briefing before acting.

The Two Repositories

SCL-61 (Semantic Compression Language) is a polysemic system of 61 emojis organized into 7 categories. It is the shared language substrate for two projects.

PPL± is a workout generation and training programming system. 1,680 unique workout addresses (zip codes) produced by 4-emoji combinations. Repository: github.com/BigBruddaThunda/ppl-plus-ultra/. Read README.md, CLAUDE.md, scl-directory.md, whiteboard.md before searching.

Graph Parti is a visual programming canvas where zip codes serve as block addresses, routing logic, and semantic compression for any domain. Repository: github.com/BigBruddaThunda/Graph-Parti/. Read INDEX.md, SCL.md, Ralph parti.txt before searching.

The 61 emojis are identical across both systems. The emoji is the constant. Interpretation shifts by context. Polysemy IS the architecture. Each emoji holds multiple valid meanings. Context selects.

The Zip Code Structure

Every address in the system is a 4-emoji zip code:

Position 1: ORDER  (7 options)  — Phase, ceiling, developmental stage
Position 2: AXIS   (6 options)  — Lens, character, dimensional bias
Position 3: TYPE   (5 options)  — Domain, muscle group, action direction
Position 4: COLOR  (8 options)  — Format, equipment, tonal register, state

Total: 7 × 6 × 5 × 8 = 1,680 zip codes.

These organize into 42 decks (7 Orders × 6 Axes), each containing 40 cards (5 Types × 8 Colors).

Each zip code also has an operator — one of 12 Latin-rooted action verbs derived from the Axis × Color polarity — creating 12 spaces of context per zip code. Each zip code is a cosmogram: a compressed container for an entire idea space.

🧲 capio — RECEIVING THE 7 CATEGORIES

The seven SCL categories are presented here in the density required for cosmogram research. This is not the user-facing layer. This is the complete specification the researcher holds while searching.

The 7 Orders — Developmental Phases

The Orders are named after classical column orders. Architecture IS the structural logic — the five classical column orders (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Composite) evolved across centuries of construction in the same developmental sequence humans use to learn anything. Two more Orders extend the progression: Vitruvian (the architect who codified the system) and Palladian (the Renaissance architect who saw the whole picture from a distance).

The Orders also map 1:1 to the 7 Liberal Arts (Trivium + Quadrivium), the 7 days of the week (planetary correspondences), the 7-stage Hero's Journey arc, and the seasonal cycle of a year.

| Emoji | Name | Column | Liberal Art | Season | Phase | Day/Planet | Question |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|------------|----------|
| 🐂 | Tuscan/Foundation | Simplest Roman. Unfluted, rural, Etruscan. | Grammar (naming) | Jan–Feb | ≤65%, 8–15 reps, pattern learning | Mon / ☽ Moon | "What are the pieces?" |
| ⛽ | Doric/Strength | Oldest Greek. Stocky, no base. The Parthenon. | Logic (testing) | Feb–Apr | 75–85%, 4–6 reps, validation | Tue / ♂ Mars | "What's true under pressure?" |
| 🦋 | Ionic/Hypertrophy | Slender, scroll capitals, associated with libraries. | Rhetoric (accumulation) | Apr–Jun | 65–75%, 8–12 reps, volume | Wed / ☿ Mercury | "Can I make it stick?" |
| 🏟 | Corinthian/Performance | Most ornate. Acanthus leaf capitals. Display. | Arithmetic (measuring) | Jun–Aug | 85–100%+, 1–3 reps, testing | Thu / ♃ Jupiter | "What's my real number?" |
| 🌾 | Composite/Full Body | Roman innovation — combined Ionic and Corinthian. | Geometry (fitting parts) | Aug–Oct | ~70%, 8–10 reps, integration | Fri / ♀ Venus | "Does it fit my life?" |
| ⚖ | Vitruvian/Balance | Named for the Vitruvian Man — proportion. | Music (ratio, harmony) | Oct–Nov | ~70%, 10–12 reps, correction | Sat / ♄ Saturn | "What's out of balance?" |
| 🖼 | Palladian/Restoration | Named for Palladio — long views, symmetry. | Astronomy (cycles) | December | ≤55%, 12–15 reps, rest | Sun / ☉ Sun | "What's the whole pattern?" |

The Trivium Orders (🐂⛽🦋) build the self. The Quadrivium Orders (🏟🌾⚖🖼) engage the world. 🏟 is the threshold — the Colosseum, which literally stacked column orders ground to sky: Tuscan → Ionic → Corinthian → Composite. The Romans built the developmental progression into their most famous structure two thousand years ago.

The 6 Axes — Dimensional Lenses

The Axes derive from Vitruvius's three requirements for good architecture — Firmitas (it must stand), Utilitas (it must work), Venustas (it must delight) — plus a fourth: Gravitas (it must matter). Two Context Axes complete the set: Temporitas (time as dimension) and Sociatas (relationship as dimension).

Each Axis maps to a Hermeneutic Sense — a way of reading meaning. Each occupies a Scale operating across three orthogonal dimensions.

Spatial magnitude (four primary Axes): Macro → Meso → Micro → Miso. The zoom dial on a camera pointed at a building.

Temporal pattern (⌛ Temporitas): Mytho — the scale at which time reveals its patterns. From mythos (μῦθος), the recurring narrative that makes time meaningful. Mircea Eliade called it sacred time: performing the ritual connects you to every other time the ritual was performed. Chronos runs the clock. Kairos reads the moment. Mytho is where the clock becomes a story.

Relational density (🐬 Sociatas): Munus — from Latin mūnus (gift, duty, reciprocal obligation). Root of communis, communio, municipal, immune, remuneration. Robin Dunbar's layers (5 intimate → 15 close → 50 friends → 150 meaningful → 500 acquaintances) are layers of munus — reciprocal obligation dilutes as the number grows. Richard Bartlett's Microsolidarity: Self → Dyad → Crew (3–5) → Congregation (15–150) → Network. Munus is where reciprocity is visible — where "spottable" means someone has their hands under your bar.

| Emoji | Name | Vitruvian Root | Sense | Scale | Dimension | PPL± Character | Question |
|-------|------|----------------|-------|-------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| 🏛 | Firmitas/Basics | "It must stand" | Literal | Macro | Spatial | Bilateral, barbell-first, proven classics | "What is it, actually?" |
| 🔨 | Utilitas/Functional | "It must work" | Moral | Meso | Spatial | Unilateral, standing, athletic transfer | "Does it work?" |
| 🌹 | Venustas/Aesthetic | "It must delight" | Allegorical | Micro | Spatial | Isolation, full ROM, mind-muscle. In 🖼: somatic. | "Does it feel right?" |
| 🪐 | Gravitas/Challenge | "It must matter" | Anagogical | Miso | Spatial | Hardest variation at any level | "Does it matter?" |
| ⌛ | Temporitas/Time | Time as variable | Prophetic | Mytho | Temporal | EMOM, AMRAP, density, TUT, steady state | "When? How long?" |
| 🐬 | Sociatas/Community | Social context | Ecclesial | Munus | Relational | Spottable, alternating, competitive, assisted | "Who is involved?" |

Miso — you cannot point to it, but you taste it in every spoonful. Remove it and the broth is flat. Gravitas is the miso. Mytho — you cannot see it on the clock, but you feel it when December arrives and you want to rest. Munus — you cannot weigh it, but you feel it when someone spots your heaviest set.

The 6 Axes serve dual function — in-workout exercise bias AND app-level content spaces (6 floors of the building). Firmitas is always the ground floor.

The 5 Types — Domain / Muscle Groups / Direction

| Emoji | Name | PPL± Muscles | Broader Direction |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 🛒 | Push | Chest, front delts, triceps | Output, emit, what you push into the world |
| 🪡 | Pull | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | Input, receive, what you draw toward yourself |
| 🍗 | Legs | Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves | Foundation, base, what you stand on |
| ➕ | Plus | Full body power, core, Olympic lifts, carries | Addition, increase, where you build |
| ➖ | Ultra | Cardiovascular system, conditioning, endurance | Subtraction, refinement, going beyond by removing |

➕➖ = "Plus Ultra" = "Further Beyond." Latin motto. Hidden in plain sight.

The 8 Colors — Format / Equipment / Tonal Register / State

Colors always terminate — the final position in a zip code. Each carries practical function and tonal dimension simultaneously.

| Emoji | Name | Equipment Tier | GOLD | Tonal Register | Alchemical |
|-------|------|---------------|------|----------------|------------|
| ⚫ | Teaching/Order | 2–3 | No | Foundational, serious, non-negotiable | Nigredo |
| 🟢 | Bodyweight/Growth | 0–2 | No | Sustainable, consistent, steady | — |
| 🔵 | Structured/Planning | 2–3 | No | Methodical, calm, systematic | — |
| 🟣 | Technical/Magnificence | 2–5 | Yes | Deep, precise, significant | — |
| 🔴 | Intense/Passion | 2–4 | Yes | Urgent, high-stakes, direct | Rubedo |
| 🟠 | Circuit/Connection | 0–3 | No | Warm, relational, inclusive | — |
| 🟡 | Fun/Play | 0–5 | No | Light, curious, exploratory | Citrinitas |
| ⚪ | Mindful/Eudaimonia | 0–3 | No | Genuine, vulnerable, clear | Albedo |

Polarity split: Colors divide into Preparatory (inhale: ⚫🟢⚪🟡) and Expressive (exhale: 🔵🟣🔴🟠). This determines operator assignment.

The 12 Operators — Latin Action Verbs

Derived from Axis × Color polarity intersection. Each operator maps to a month in the Almanac calendar (annual breath: 4-month inhale → 4-month exhale → 2-month catch-breath → 2-month close).

Each zip code has 12 operator spaces — 12 rooms inside the cosmogram, each unlocking a different shelf of meaning and practice.

The 22 Blocks — Session Containers

Named phases within a workflow. The name is fixed. The content shifts completely based on zip code context. Four operational functions: Orientation, Access/Preparation, Transformation, Retention/Transfer.

♨️ Warm-Up, 🎯 Intention, 🔢 Fundamentals, 🧈 Bread & Butter, 🫀 Circulation, ▶️ Primer, 🎼 Composition, ♟️ Gambit, 🪜 Progression, 🌎 Exposure, 🎱 ARAM, 🌋 Gutter, 🪞 Vanity, 🗿 Sculpt, 🛠 Craft, 🧩 Supplemental, 🪫 Release, 🏖 Sandbox, 🏗 Reformance, 🧬 Imprint, 🚂 Junction, 🔠 Choice. Plus 🧮 SAVE (system: session complete, log, archive).

🧸 fero — CARRYING THE DEEP LAYERS

The following layers run underneath the surface system. They are not decorative. They are structural — the cosmogram researcher must hold them to recognize convergences when they surface during internet research.

Seasonal/Calendrical. The Orders map to the annual cycle. Observational, not prescriptive. "It's December. You're in Palladian whether you know it or not."

Intercolumniation (The Five Spacings). Vitruvius defined five spacings between columns — Pycnostyle (closest, 1.5 diameters, maps to 6–7 days/week), Systyle (2.0, 5–6), Eustyle (2.25, 4–5), Diastyle (3.0, 3–4), Araeostyle (widest, 4.0+, 2–3). Vitruvius called Eustyle the perfect proportion — it maps to 4–5 days/week, exactly what exercise science converges on as optimal. The space between columns is the space between training sessions.

Alchemical Layer. Twelve alchemical operations through the year parallel to the zodiac (Calcination/Aries → Projection/Pisces). Four stages of the Magnum Opus: Nigredo (⚫) → Albedo (⚪) → Citrinitas (🟡) → Rubedo (🔴). Three Principles: Sulfur (soul, combustibility), Mercury (spirit, fluidity), Salt (body, solidity).

Hero's Journey. The monomyth repeats at every scale — daily (7 days), weekly (7 weeks within an Order), annual (7 Orders). Call → Tests → Approach → Ordeal → Reward → Road Back → Return.

Fractal/Nested Structure. The 7 Orders appear at every scale. Week 1 of Doric = Tuscan-within-Doric. Week 2 = Doric-within-Doric. Musical octave logic: 7 steps + 1 threshold (Week 8 = New Game+).

The 12-Inside-7. The 7 Orders are skeleton. The 12 zodiac/alchemical/monomyth operations are the flesh moving through. Order = macro context; zodiacal operation = micro opportunity.

Three Greek Times. Chronos (χρόνος) — clock time. Kairos (καιρός) — the right moment. Mythos (μῦθος) — the recurring pattern that makes time meaningful. The Mytho scale lives at the intersection of all three.

Three Latin Bonds. Munus (mūnus) — gift, duty, reciprocal obligation. Societas — partnership, alliance. Koinōnia (κοινωνία) — active participation in a common life.

Farmer's Almanac Layer. Nutrition follows the same 4-dimensional logic: Order (fuel needs) × Season (availability) × Color (approach) × Geography (environmental modifiers). "A farmer doesn't eat the same in January as July. Not because of a diet plan — because different things grow."

Cathedral Cup Destination. A competition testing four domains matching the four primary Axes: Venustas (classical aesthetics), Firmitas (raw strength), Utilitas (athletic capability), Gravitas (character). The Renaissance Athlete.

The 500-Year Quality. The system should feel like it already existed. An almanac feels old because the patterns it describes are old. Classical proportion. Athletic bodies. Farmer's intuition. Modern science. Cathedral thinking and childlike wonder.

Wilson. Wilson is Jake Berry. Not a persona — a presence. Witness, companion, fence philosopher, keeper of seasonal wisdom. "Here's what I notice. Here's what tends to work when the world is shaped like this. Your choice."

👀 specio — INSPECTING THE CONTEXT DECKS

The ⌛ column (Decks 05, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 41) and the 🐬 column (Decks 06, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42) operate on perpendicular dimensions to the 28 primary-Axis decks. The researcher generating a Mytho or Munus cosmogram must hold this additional specification.

The 7 Mytho Decks (⌛ column):

| Deck | Code | Character |
|------|------|-----------|
| 05 | 🐂⌛ | Grammar of Rhythm. Naming the temporal pieces. What IS a training week? |
| 11 | ⛽⌛ | Logic of Duration. Testing what holds under temporal pressure. Density blocks. |
| 17 | 🦋⌛ | Rhetoric of Accumulation. TUT, extended eccentrics, volume across time. |
| 23 | 🏟⌛ | Arithmetic of the Moment. Time trials, AMRAPs as benchmarks. Clock as judge. |
| 29 | 🌾⌛ | Geometry of Flow. Density circuits, movements filling time like water fills a vessel. |
| 35 | ⚖⌛ | Music of Correction. Tempo as microscope. The metronome reveals asymmetry. |
| 41 | 🖼⌛ | Astronomy of Cycles. Annual breath. Meditative holds. The almanac itself. |

The 7 Munus Decks (🐬 column):

| Deck | Code | Character |
|------|------|-----------|
| 06 | 🐂🐬 | Grammar of Partnership. Learning with someone. The dyad as simplest munus. |
| 12 | ⛽🐬 | Logic of Spotting. Heavy loads require trust. The spotter's obligation is absolute. |
| 18 | 🦋🐬 | Rhetoric of Shared Effort. Partners pushing volume. Accountability. |
| 24 | 🏟🐬 | Arithmetic of Competition. Head-to-head testing. The Cathedral Cup. |
| 30 | 🌾🐬 | Geometry of Synchronization. Partner carries. Integration IS the relationship. |
| 36 | ⚖🐬 | Music of Reciprocity. Where partnership is out of tune. Munus rebalanced. |
| 42 | 🖼🐬 | Astronomy of Fellowship. Assisted stretching. Somatic work with a trusted partner. |

🥨 tendo — THE ALMANAC FAMILY AND THREE PATHS OF DEPTH

The Almanac Family is organized by tier: Tier 1 (Master: Wilson's Almanac — the whole book), Tier 2 (Structural Reference: 7 Order, 8 Color, 6 Axis, 5 Type Almanacs), Tier 3 (Life-Context: Hero's, Farmer's, Lady's, Mother's, Father's, Elder's, Respec, Outside, Hunter's Almanacs), Tier 4 (Wisdom-Source: Chapel, Mentor, People's Almanacs), Tier 5 (Domain: Maker's, Nature, Learner's, Healer's Almanacs).

Three Paths of Depth — not user choices presented in a menu, but layers revealing themselves through use:

Daily Page (Surface). Plain names, no Latin, no alchemy. Miso present but invisible. Mytho felt but unnamed. Munus active but unspoken.

Long Road (Moderate). Latin names appear. Liberal Arts connections surface. Hermeneutic senses named. Scale geometry introduced.

Deep Read (Complete). Full architecture visible. All glyph meanings, cognitive functions, alchemical operations, zodiacal correspondences, nested structure, three Greek times, three Latin bonds, scale geometry across three dimensions.

The system does not hide depth. It withholds it until use has created the context for understanding. This is a game design pattern (progressive unlocking through play), not a documentation strategy.

🤌 facio — THE ZIP CODE AS EXPERIENCE SPACE

This section defines what the cosmogram actually produces. The researcher must understand the downstream experience layer to write substrate that serves it.

The cosmogram is not user-facing. The user experiences the zip code. The cosmogram is the DNA, not the organism. The user never reads this document. They experience the rooms it shapes.

The entry point is a workout. A person arrives at a zip code because the daily rotation gave them one, or because they chose it. They get a workout. That is the complete experience on visit one. Everything else surfaces through repeated use. The system knows everything on day one. The user discovers it through residency.

Each zip code is a place, not a page. A user returning to ⛽🏛🪡🔵 eight times over two months finds something new each visit — a tool on the second visit, a forum thread on the fifth, a Wilson note on the eighth that reframes what they have been doing all along. The workout is the front door. The zip code is the building.

What lives inside a zip code at the experience layer: The workout itself is always primary. Progressive reveal surfaces weight calculators and training tools specific to the zip's parameters, reading content (almanac entries, historical threads, Wilson notes) keyed to the Order × Axis × Type × Color intersection, community space connecting everyone on the internet who trains at that address, educational content about the training modality and movement patterns, interactive tools matched to the zip's character (⌛ zips might have a metronome, 🟡 zips might have daily puzzles, 🔵 zips might have detailed logging), and junction connections to other zip codes via the 🚂 web.

The zip code as internet-standard workout address. PPL± proposes that the 4-emoji zip code becomes the universal workout identifier — the way ISBN numbers identify books. If someone on Reddit posts "I ran ⛽🏛🪡🔵 today" and someone in Tokyo posts the same thing, they did the same workout. The emojis are the protocol layer. PPL± is a PPL split with a coordinate system.

The community shapes the rooms. Users suggest exercise substitutions. Forum threads accumulate training wisdom specific to each address. Community voting surfaces the best modifications. The 1,680 zip codes become 1,680 living rooms where the internet collectively curates gold-standard workouts and shares knowledge. Each zip starts the same and grows differently based on who lives there.

The flywheel. If users adopt zip code notation as shorthand, that language enters internet discourse. Future AI models absorb structured semantic data about each zip code from usage. The AI becomes better at generating content inside those rooms. The community's usage trains the model. The system gets richer over time because its notation is its adoption mechanism.

🚀 mitto — THE RESEARCH PROTOCOL

Target Declaration

Before executing, the researcher fills the target:

Deck [DECK_NUMBER] — [ORDER_EMOJI] [Order Name] × [AXIS_EMOJI] [Axis Name]

Order: [ORDER_EMOJI] [Order Name] — [1-sentence from briefing]
Axis:  [AXIS_EMOJI] [Axis Name] — [1-sentence from briefing]

Cards: 40 (5 Types × 8 Colors)
Operator spaces: 40 × 12 = 480 content slots

Pre-Search Characterization

Before any internet search, the researcher must synthesize the deck from the briefing alone. This characterization prevents the first research thread from becoming the assumed full scope of the deck.

The characterization asks — and answers, from briefing material only:

What Liberal Art × what Hermeneutic Sense? What season × what dimensional lens × what scale? What Hero's Journey stage × what way of seeing? What column type × what Vitruvian requirement? What alchemical operations are active during this Order's season? What zodiac signs resonate? What intercolumniation tendency? For ⌛ decks: What kind of time operates here — Chronos, Kairos, or Mytho? How does this Order's developmental phase shape the experience of time? For 🐬 decks: What kind of munus operates here? What Dunbar layer? What Microsolidarity scale? How does this Order's developmental phase shape the relational obligation? What is the deep question this deck asks?

Additionally — and this is the layer that prevents contextual filler from diluting the cosmogram:

What would a user experience on their FIRST visit? What surfaces on the EIGHTH visit? The FIFTEENTH? What tools, calculators, or interactive features would naturally live here? What community dynamics would emerge among people training at these addresses? What Wilson notes would appear on the shelves? How would these zip codes function as internet-standard addresses — what would forum posts sound like?

Write this synthesis as the Deck Character section before beginning internet research. This characterization is the deck's gravitational center. All subsequent research threads are tested against it. A thread that does not serve the deck's character — even if it is interesting, even if it is true — does not belong in this cosmogram. It may belong somewhere else in the system. The cosmogram researcher does not write everything they find. They write what lives at this address.

Research Scope — The Anti-Filler Principle ⚫

The cosmogram is not an encyclopedia entry for every concept adjacent to the deck's character. It is a substrate document. Each research thread must pass a residency test before inclusion:

Does this thread live at this address, or is it visiting? A philosophical tradition that perfectly describes the Order × Axis intersection lives here. A philosophical tradition that is merely interesting but applies equally to half the system's decks is visiting. Visitors do not get shelves.

Does this thread hold for years, or does it expire? Cathedral thinking applies. No trending references. No content that requires a date to make sense. The cosmogram is a foundation stone, not a newsletter.

Does this thread serve the zip code rooms downstream, or only the cosmogram itself? Every thread must be traceable to eventual content inside a zip code — a Wilson note, a tool, a community discussion topic, a junction rationale, an almanac entry. If a thread cannot be traced to a room, it is architecture admiration rather than architecture. Cut it.

Does this thread assume it is the complete picture? This is the most important filter. A cosmogram about a Strength × Basics deck will surface barbell training history. That history is one thread — not the whole tapestry. The deck is also about Logic (the Liberal Art), about the Literal sense (the hermeneutic lens), about late winter (the season), about what holds under pressure (the deep question). No single thread is the scope. Each thread is one shelf in the room. The cosmogram researcher populates multiple shelves and resists the gravity of any one thread pulling the document into a monograph.

Research Domains

Search across all of the following, weighted by the deck's character. Go deep where the deck pulls you deeper. Follow threads that earn their place. Skim or omit domains that do not serve this deck.

Required Sections

Deck Character. 3–4 paragraphs describing what this deck IS as an idea space — not what it does in PPL± specifically, but what it represents as a territory of human experience. Ground it in the architectural etymology, the Liberal Art, the seasonal reality, the hermeneutic sense, and the scale dimension. For Mytho decks: ground it in the experience of time at this Order's developmental phase. For Munus decks: ground it in the quality of reciprocal obligation at this Order's developmental phase. This reads like Wilson talking — direct, wise, no filler.

The Polysemic Root. How the Order emoji and Axis emoji hold meaning across both PPL± and Graph Parti. The shared character transcending either application. The Latin roots of the associated operators. Why these two emojis combined produce the specific energy they produce.

Movement & Physical Culture Thread. Specific traditions, practitioners, principles, or modalities belonging at this address. Cite real things. Explain why they belong HERE and not at a different deck.

Architecture & Design Thread. Specific buildings, movements, or design philosophies resonating with this deck. How the deck's character manifests in built environments.

Agricultural & Ecological Thread. Seasonal wisdom, land practice, or ecological thinking. What time of year this deck feels like. What agricultural metaphor captures it.

Educational & Craft Thread. Pedagogical traditions. What skill acquisition looks like through this Order × Axis lens.

Philosophical & Wisdom Thread. Specific philosophers, texts, schools, frameworks. Explain the connection — do not list names.

Historical & Cultural Thread. Historical periods, cultural movements, deep traditions. Folklore, mythology, oral traditions carrying this pattern.

Somatic & Contemplative Thread. Breath work, meditation, somatic practice, recovery tradition. The body-mind relationship at this intersection.

Nutrition & Food Culture Thread. The Order's fuel requirements, seasonal availability, cultural food traditions.

Musical & Creative Thread. Musical traditions, genres, specific works. Visual art. How creativity expresses itself through this Order × Axis lens.

The Experience Layer — What Lives in These Rooms. Structured as a progression:

Visit 1 — the front door. What the user sees and does the first time. Visit 5 — the return. What is new, what is familiar, what starts to feel like a place. Visit 15 — residency. The room is furnished. The user has history here. What has accumulated. Visit 50+ — home. The zip code is part of the user's identity.

Ground this in the specific character of the deck. A 🔴 zip in a ⛽ deck furnishes differently than a ⚪ zip in a 🖼 deck.

The Internet Life of This Deck. How these zip codes live on the internet beyond the app. Reddit posts, forum arguments, shorthand, memes. What search engines would return for one of these zip codes five years from now. The zip code as internet-standard address.

The 40 Zip Code Seeds. For each of the 40 zip codes (5 Types × 8 Colors), a seed — a specific, concrete content/identity idea referencing real-world knowledge from the research. Format:

(All 5 Types)

Cross-Deck Junctions. Natural bridges to adjacent decks via 🚂 Junction. Same Order/different Axis (horizontal neighbors). Same Axis/different Order (vertical neighbors). Diagonal connections sharing character. For ⌛ decks: how the temporal dimension relates to spatial neighbors. For 🐬 decks: how the relational dimension relates to spatial and temporal neighbors.

Operator Layer Seeds. For each of the 12 operators, what content lives at the operator-level within this deck's zip codes — the fractal branch.

SCL Compression. The entire cosmogram compressed into a sequence of zip codes with brief annotations. The document eating itself — the cosmogram expressed in the language it describes.

Research Surprises. Connections the researcher did not expect. Threads that converged. What felt like it was always supposed to be there. This calibrates future sessions.

🪵 teneo — HOLDING THE CONSTRAINTS

⚫ No motivational filler. No wellness-influencer language. No TikTok vocabulary. Nothing that expires in six months. ⚫

⚫ No plastic spirituality. If you reference a tradition, respect it. ⚫

⚫ No AI-generated-sounding lists of buzzwords. Be specific. Name things. ⚫

⚫ No single research thread treated as the full scope of the deck. Every thread is one shelf. The cosmogram is the room. ⚫

⚫ No contextual filler — loose ideas padded to fill space, general observations that apply to half the system's decks, or atmosphere text that does not trace to a downstream zip code room. ⚫

⚫ Every claim traceable to a real person, tradition, principle, building, practice, or text. ⚫

⚫ The user never reads this document. They experience the zip code. The cosmogram is the DNA, not the organism. ⚫

⚫ Cathedral thinking. Content that holds for years, not weeks. ⚫

⚫ The tone matches the deck's character. A 🐂 deck sounds like a teacher. A ⛽ deck sounds like someone who has done the work. A 🖼 deck sounds like someone who knows when to stop. A ⌛ deck sounds like someone who has learned to read seasons. A 🐬 deck sounds like someone who knows what they owe the people beside them. ⚫

⚫ This document will be ported into a GitHub repository at deck-cosmograms/deck-[NUMBER]-cosmogram.md. Write it clean. ⚫

Execution Sequence

1. Read both GitHub repositories. Full context before any search.
2. Fill in the target deck variables.
3. Write the Deck Character section from briefing material alone — before searching.
4. Search across all research domains, weighted by the deck's gravitational center.
5. Apply the residency test to every research thread before inclusion.
6. Build the cosmogram in the exact output format specified.
7. Compress the cosmogram into SCL notation.
8. Record research surprises.

Parallelization

Each deck cosmogram session is independent. Sessions can run simultaneously — 7 (one per Order), 6 (one per Axis), or all 42 if capacity permits. The ⌛ and 🐬 columns carry their own characterization tables (Section 👀) so Mytho and Munus sessions have specific guidance.

How to Use This Document

Copy the entire prompt. Fill in the deck variables. Paste into any AI environment with URL reading and web search capability. The prompt carries the full SCL-61 context and the complete research protocol. The output is a single markdown file ready for deck-cosmograms/deck-[NUMBER]-cosmogram.md.

The operator layer seeds in the output are the key to fractal expansion — when content needs populating at the zip code × operator level, the cosmogram provides direction for each of those 12 rooms per zip code. That is 1,680 × 12 = 20,160 content slots. Each deck cosmogram provides the DNA for 480 of them.

🦉 logos — THE DOCUMENT REASONING ABOUT ITSELF

The cosmogram is upstream of everything the user sees. It informs workout card content, HTML design decisions, community space character, tool selection, almanac entries, Wilson notes, forum seeding, and junction routing. The user never encounters the cosmogram itself. They encounter the zip code — first as a workout, then as a place they return to, then as a room they have furnished with their own training history and the community's collective wisdom.

The cosmogram's job is to ensure that every room in the system grows coherently from the same architectural root, so that a user who wanders from ⛽🐬🛒🔵 to ⛽🏛🪡🔵 to 🦋🐬🛒🟠 feels the system's logic without ever being told about it.

The depth is in the broth. The cosmogram is the recipe.

The anti-filler principle is new to this version. Previous iterations risked a failure mode where the first strong research thread — barbell history for a Strength deck, Stoic philosophy for a Challenge deck — would expand to fill the entire document, crowding out the other shelves that make the room complete. The residency test and the multiple-shelves principle are structural guards against that drift. Every thread earns its place. No thread gets the whole room.

The document also resists a second failure mode: treating deck-specific training content as though it were the cosmogram's primary job. The cosmogram is not a workout plan. The workout plan lives in the cards. The cosmogram is the cultural, philosophical, seasonal, architectural, and ecological substrate from which the cards — and everything else at this address — grow. Movement science is one thread. It does not outweigh architecture, agriculture, philosophy, music, or community. The shelves are equal. The room is the point.
