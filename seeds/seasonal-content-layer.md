# Seasonal Content Layer

The PPL± Almanac is a Farmer's Almanac. It tracks time the way farmers tracked time — not by abstract calendar units but by what the land is doing right now. Each of the 12 months has an operator. Each operator has an agricultural practice underneath it. That practice grounds the content of the Almanac floor for that month.

This document specifies how seasonal content (food, agriculture, lifestyle, weather, rhythm) maps to the 12-month operator calendar and how it lives inside the ⌛ Temporitas floor.

---

## What This Layer Is

Seasonal content is the **Almanac floor's non-workout content**. Workout cards live everywhere in the system (all 6 floors). Seasonal content lives specifically on ⌛ Temporitas — the calendar floor, the time floor, the floor that knows what month it is.

The seasonal layer is not a nutrition program. Not a medical recommendation. Not lifestyle coaching. It is **observational content** — what is growing, what is available, what the body tends to need, what the climate is doing — presented without prescription. A reference layer, not a directive.

Users opt in to regional filtering. Nothing is tracked by GPS. The seasonal content defaults to a generalized Northern Hemisphere agricultural calendar unless the user has set a region.

## The 12-Month Content Map

Each month carries an operator, an agricultural practice, and a seasonal content direction.

---

### January — 📍 pono — Positioning

**Agricultural practice:** Walking frozen fields, mapping soil, equipment repair, testing last year's seeds against germination rates.

**Seasonal content direction:**
- Root vegetables at peak (carrots, parsnips, celeriac, beets, winter squash)
- Cold-climate protein sources (legumes from dry storage, preserved meats)
- Training adjustment: lower ambient energy, shorter daylight — consolidation training appropriate
- Lifestyle rhythm: early darkness supports earlier sleep; morning light limited
- Almanac content type: goal mapping, annual training calendar, equipment audit

**Content examples:**
- "Root vegetable prep: 5 approaches that work for January storage stock"
- "Setting your training address for the year — the zip calendar"
- "What grows in January: the underground inventory"

## Regional Filter Integration

This seasonal content map is Northern Hemisphere by default. The agricultural calendar assumes spring = March–May, summer = June–August, fall = September–November, winter = December–February.

For Southern Hemisphere users who opt into regional filtering (see `seeds/regional-filter-architecture.md`):
- The seasonal content shifts 6 months: December becomes summer content, June becomes winter content
- Produce calendars flip accordingly
- No GPS tracking — regional setting is a user toggle, explicitly set

For users who set no region: default Northern Hemisphere content applies. No assumption about location.

---

## Content Lives on the ⌛ Temporitas Floor

All seasonal content belongs to the ⌛ Temporitas floor (the Almanac floor, the time floor, the calendar). It is the floor that knows what month it is.

This content does not appear on other floors unless editorially featured (e.g., the 🧈 Bread & Butter seasonal recipe of the week appearing in an Operis edition that links back to Temporitas).

The ⌛ floor is where users come to check the calendar, plan their training cycle, see what season it is, and read the Farmer's Almanac layer.

---

## What This Content Is Not

- Not nutritional advice. Not medical recommendations.
- Not a meal plan. Not a diet protocol.
- Not a shopping list (though a produce calendar is close to one).
- Not a prescription. The observation-level only.

PPL± does not tell users what to eat. It observes what is seasonally available and what the body tends toward in each season. The user decides what to do with that information.
