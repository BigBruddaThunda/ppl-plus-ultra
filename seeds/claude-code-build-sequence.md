# 🏗 Claude Code Build Sequence — 20 Sessions from Skeleton to Production

🔵🔨 — structured + functional

## How To Use This Document

This document is the execution roadmap for building the PPL± experience layer. It is written for Claude Code sessions that will execute each step.

Each session is scoped to produce a working increment. "Working" means: you can run it, navigate to it, and the specified behavior is observable. Nothing is "done" until the test section passes.

Sessions do not have to be executed in strict sequence, but the dependency chain must be honored. Dependencies are noted per session.

**Session pattern:**
1. Read this session's entry in this document
2. Read any referenced seed/schema documents
3. Build only what is listed under "Build this session"
4. Do NOT build anything listed under "Not this session"
5. Confirm the test criteria pass before marking the session complete
6. Update whiteboard.md with results

## LAUNCH SESSIONS (A through N)

---

### Session A — Next.js Skeleton + Zip Routing

**Goal:** A running Next.js app with proof-of-concept numeric zip routing.

**Depends on:** Nothing (Session A is the root).

**Build this session:**
1. Initialize Next.js 14 app with App Router and TypeScript in `/ppl-plus-ultra-app/` (separate from the cards repo)
2. Install: tailwindcss, zustand, @supabase/supabase-js (no auth yet)
3. Create `/app/zip/[zipcode]/page.tsx` — accepts 4-digit zip in URL
4. Implement `isValidZip()` and `zipToEmoji()` from `seeds/numeric-zip-system.md`
5. Room page renders: zip code display (numeric + emoji), placeholder card area
6. Create `/app/page.tsx` — homepage redirects to `/zip/2123` (today's placeholder)
7. Implement 404 for invalid zip codes (e.g., `/zip/9999` → not found page)

**Not this session:** Auth, database, real card content, dials, drawer, payment.

**Test before done:**
- `http://localhost:3000/zip/2123` loads and shows ⛽🏛🪡🔵
- `http://localhost:3000/zip/7658` loads and shows 🖼🐬➖⚪
- `http://localhost:3000/zip/9999` shows a 404 page
- `http://localhost:3000/` redirects to a zip page

---

### Session B — Card Rendering

**Goal:** Actual `.md` card content renders in the room.

**Depends on:** Session A.

**Build this session:**
1. Install: @next/mdx, gray-matter (or next-mdx-remote)
2. Copy all card `.md` files from `/cards/` into the app's static content directory (or reference via file path)
3. Parse frontmatter to extract zip, status, operator, deck
4. Build `WorkoutCard` React component — renders block sections with emoji headers
5. Build `BlockSection` component — renders each 🧈 🔢 ♨️ etc. block
6. Room page at `/zip/[zipcode]` now renders actual card content for GENERATED/CANONICAL cards
7. EMPTY status → show construction placeholder ("This room is being built")
8. Implement basic typographic styles in Tailwind

**Not this session:** Dials, drawer, logging, interactive elements, auth.

**Test before done:**
- `/zip/2123` renders ⛽🏛🪡🔵 card content (a Deck 07 card, if generated)
- Block sections are visually distinct

   - Layer 2: floor keywords (6 floors × synonyms)
   - Layer 3: content type keywords (subset for launch — top 30 types)
2. Build `scoreInput()` function — tokenize, match, score each layer
3. Build `routeFromParse()` — converts parse result to Next.js route
4. Build `VoiceInput` component — text input field + mic button (Web Speech API)
5. Wire into Tool Drawer as search input
