# Art Direction — The PPL± Aesthetic

## One Sentence

Beaux-arts watercolor rendering + 90s computer UI + classical architecture + trace paper = a design language where classical architecture went on a lucid trip on 90s UI and LEGO.

## Typography Stack

- **Primary:** Architectural serif (Freight Text, or hand-lettering warmth of a Beaux-Arts plate)
- **Monospace:** Chunky 90s feel (Chicago, Geneva, Berkeley Mono) — used for zip codes, set notation, ± system
- **Rule:** Zip codes always render in mono. Exercise names in serif. Cues in italic serif.

## Texture Layers

- **Background:** trace paper warmth — off-white, faint grid lines, paper grain
- **Block borders:** watercolor wash edges, slightly bleeding, hand-rendered feel
- **Expand states:** color wash intensifies, paint being applied to trace paper
- **Card shell:** heavy outer border like architectural plate or trading card, crisp corners (not rounded)

## The 90s UI Layer

- **Buttons:** System 7 / Windows 3.1 bevel — raised, tactile, pixel-aware
- **Toolbar:** chunky icon buttons with visible borders (early Mac toolbox)
- **Scrollbars:** classic stepped appearance
- **Dialog boxes:** retro modal — title bar, close button, inset field

## The 8-bit / LEGO / Abacus Quality

- SCL emojis as LEGO bricks snapping into grid positions
- Zip code display: abacus row — four beads, each in its color
- Deck browser: grid of tiles/trading cards — bold, colorful, distinct plates

## What Keeps It From Feeling Childish

- Serif typography anchors authority
- Latin operator names add gravitas
- Muted warm palette (terracotta not neon, gold not yellow)
- Watercolor texture adds age and craft
- Content is serious and precise
- Tone: "an architect's studio that happens to have a Super Nintendo in it"

## Color Palette Direction

The 8 SCL Colors each carry dual identity (tonal name + operational name). The CSS color tokens should reflect the tonal warmth, not digital flatness:

- ⚪ Eudaimonia: warm off-white, not clinical white (#F5F0E8 range)
- 🟡 Fun/Play: aged gold, not safety yellow (#F2C744 range)
- 🟠 Connection: terracotta warmth, not traffic orange (#E07A3A range)
- 🔴 Passion: deep brick, not fire engine (#C0392B range)
- ⚫ Order: rich black with warmth, not pure #000 (#1A1A1A range)
- 🟣 Magnificence: deep plum, not electric purple (#7B4FA2 range)
- 🔵 Planning: architectural blue, not sky blue (#2E6BA6 range)
- 🟢 Growth: forest, not lime (#3A7D44 range)

## Additional Influences

- Early Windows 85, Apple Lisa — the filing and button aesthetics
- Classical architecture analytique — how the HTML pages function as plates
- Trading card / scroll / architectural plate / tarot card bordered feel
- Abacus: vibrant, classical, modern, retro

## Open Questions

- What specific serif font best captures the Beaux-Arts plate feeling?
- How much watercolor texture is too much before it becomes distracting?
- Should the 7 Orders carry distinct ornament levels in their CSS (Tuscan = plain, Corinthian = ornate)?
- Does dark mode exist? If so, does it invert the trace paper to drafting paper (dark blue/black with light lines)?
