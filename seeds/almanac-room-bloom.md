# Room Bloom — Zip Code Rooms That Grow With Use

## One Sentence

Each zip code room starts sparse and grows richer as the user visits — populating exercise history, community depth, personal notes, and pattern data over time.

## The Concept

First visit: just the workout card and empty superscript/subscript boxes. Tenth visit: history populates exercise rows, community board has depth, personal notes from previous visits appear, Junction suggestions are informed by actual patterns.

The room grows because you've been in it. The HTML space is alive, not static. This is the fundamental UX promise of PPL± — the system teaches itself through use, not through onboarding.

## Data That Blooms

- Exercise ± boxes: superscript (last/highest weight) and subscript (days since last performed)
- Personal completion count for this zip code
- Personal notes and modifications from previous visits
- Community board depth (more completions = richer recommendations)
- Junction history (what you actually did next vs. what was suggested)

## Where It's Most Visible

Room Bloom is most visible on the 🌹 Venustas floor (see seeds/axis-as-app-floors.md). That's the personal library — the floor where the card reflects you back at you. The ± boxes are full because you've been here before.

## Open Questions

- What is the minimum data threshold before a room feels "bloomed" vs. "empty"?
- Should bloom state be visually indicated (subtle background warmth, border treatment)?
- Does community bloom and personal bloom display separately or merge?
