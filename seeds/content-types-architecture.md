# 🗿 PPL± Content Types Architecture

109 Content Types. 6 Axes. 12 Operators. 7 Orders as Curriculum Depth.

🟡🔵 — curious + analytical

## One Sentence

PPL± produces 109 distinct content types mapped across 6 Axes, each type carrying an operator affinity, a primary floor address, and a curriculum depth level — the full scope of what the 1,680-room library contains and publishes.

## The Cross-Floor Appearance Rule

Some content types appear on more than one floor. This is by design, not an error.

The Publication Standard (Type 39 and Type 76) lives on both 🔨 (the operational tool) and 🪐 (the deep principle). The workout card (Type 1) lives on 🏛 (the arrival experience) and 🌹 (the personal history). The cosmogram (Type 3) lives on 🏛 (the deck reference) and 🪐 (the deep context penthouse).

Cross-floor content types are not duplicated — they are **polysemic**. The same document serves different functions depending on which floor you are viewing it from. The publication standard IS the operational constraint (🔨) AND the institutional principle (🪐). The workout card IS the daily offering (🏛) AND the historical record of what you did (🌹).

This is the same principle that governs the SCL itself: the same emoji carries multiple valid meanings by context. The content type system follows the language's own architecture.

---

## The Operator Engagement Model

Each content type carries an operator affinity — a primary action verb from the 12 SCL operators that describes how users engage with the type. The operator is not a tag; it is the verb the content type performs.

Demonstration using "Gardening" as a content type category (types that require cultivation over time):

| Content Type | Primary Operator | Engagement |
|---|---|---|
| Workout Card (1) | 🤌 facio | Execute. The doing. |
| Operis Edition (2) | 🐋 duco | Orchestrate. The editorial conduct. |
| Cosmogram (3) | 👀 specio | Inspect. The deep reading. |
| Exercise Library Entry (20) | 🧲 capio | Receive. The absorbing intake. |
| Workout Log (50) | ✒️ grapho | Write. The recording. |
| Progress Photo (56) | 👀 specio | Inspect. The honest assessment. |
| Trophy (57) | 🪵 teneo | Hold. The sustained achievement. |
| Room Thread (98) | 🦉 logos | Reason. The analytical exchange. |
| Coaching Note (104) | 🧸 fero | Carry. The transfer of knowledge. |
| Program Enrollment (64) | 🥨 tendo | Extend. The pushing of limits over time. |

The operator is the content type's primary mode of engagement. It is not exclusive — a workout card is also 👀 specio (inspect the form) and ✒️ grapho (log the sets). But the primary operator names the dominant action the content type is designed to produce.

---

## The Order-as-Curriculum Model

The 7 Orders map to 7 curriculum depth levels. Content types have a natural Order affinity — the level of prior knowledge they assume and the depth of engagement they reward.

This is the Trivium/Quadrivium mapping from the weekly editorial cadence applied to the content type system:

| Order | Liberal Art | Curriculum Level | Content Type Character |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| 🐂 Foundation | Grammar | Level 1: Naming | Definitions, profiles, the card's own format |
| ⛽ Strength | Logic | Level 2: Reasoning | Validation reports, workout logs, PR records |
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | Rhetoric | Level 3: Accumulation | Training history, archives, session collections |
| 🏟 Performance | Arithmetic | Level 4: Measurement | Progress dashboards, volume summaries, benchmarks |
| 🌾 Full Body | Geometry | Level 5: Integration | Programs as sequences, cosmograms as synthesis |
| ⚖ Balance | Music | Level 6: Proportion | Audit reports, asymmetry logs, corrective histories |
| 🖼 Restoration | Astronomy | Level 7: Long View | Platform architecture, seed documents, institutional voice |

A new user engaging at Level 1 reads workout cards and Operis editions. They do not need Level 7 (platform architecture seeds) to begin. The content type system scales with user depth. The 🏛 arrival floor contains Level 1–3 content. The 🪐 penthouse contains Level 6–7 content.

This is progressive disclosure applied to the entire content ecosystem, not just the in-session UI.

---

## Combinatorial Depth

109 content types × 12 operators × 7 curriculum levels = 9,156 possible engagement combinations.

Not all combinations are valid. A trophy (Type 57) at Level 7 (Astronomy/long view) is coherent — a trophy earned after 7 years of consistent training carries civilizational weight. A workout card (Type 1) at Level 1 (Grammar/naming) is the most common engagement — naming the exercise, following the structure.

The combinatorial depth is not a design goal. It is a consequence of building a system with genuine internal logic. The 61 SCL emojis produce 1,680 zip codes not because someone decided 1,680 was the right number — because 7 × 6 × 5 × 8 = 1,680. The 109 content types × 12 operators × 7 levels produce 9,156 engagement combinations not because 9,156 was planned — because the system's axes are genuinely independent.

This is what differentiates a semantic system from a tag cloud. Tags compose arbitrarily. SCL dimensions compose meaningfully. Every combination is either valid or invalid for clear reasons — not because someone decided, but because the underlying dimensions have their own logic.

## Open Questions

- Should the 109 content types have their own identifiers (like zip codes have addresses)?
- Are there content types missing from this inventory? (The system is likely not complete at 109.)
- Should content types have Color affinities as well as Order affinities? (A cosmogram feels 🟣 Technical. A workout log feels 🔵 Structured. A Sandbox zip code feels 🟡 Fun.)
- How does the operator affinity of a content type interact with the operator of the zip code it belongs to? (The workout card operator is derived from Axis × Color. The content type operator is independent. Do they reinforce or complicate each other?)
- Should the content type inventory be maintained in a machine-readable format (YAML, JSON) alongside this document, to power future automation?
