# The ± Exercise Row — Superscript/Subscript System

## One Sentence

Every exercise displays a superscript box (last/highest weight = the +) and a subscript box (days since last performed = the ultra/subtraction), creating a balance-scale glance layer on every exercise row.

## The Notation

```
🔵 Barbell Bench Press  ²⁶⁵  ± 4 Sets
                         ₃w
```

- **Left:** Color emoji + exercise name (identity)
- **Upper right box:** last/highest weight — the + of ±
- **Lower right box:** days since last performed — the ultra of ±
- **Far right:** ± N Sets (using ± instead of × as the PPL± set operator)
- **First time:** both boxes are empty □ — blank plate, invitation

## The Hidden Easter Egg

The ± IS plus ultra. Superscript is the plus (what you lifted). Subscript is the ultra (the distance, the subtraction from now). Every exercise carries its own ± balance. The ⚖️ of the individual exercise.

## Progressive Disclosure

- **Day 1:** empty boxes, just exercise name and set count
- **Day 30:** numbers populate, boxes become meaningful at a glance
- The system teaches itself through use, not onboarding

## Compressed Card View

When the HTML workout card is compressed to a full-screen digital card, the ± boxes make structured tracking glanceable. A user with reading glasses can scan the card and know: what exercise, how much weight last time, how long since they did it, how many sets. Four data points per row, no paragraph reading required. None of this is obvious on day 1, but by day 30 it's all intuitive.

## Open Questions

- Should the superscript show last weight or personal best? (Or toggle between them?)
- What unit does the subscript use? (Days: "3D", Weeks: "3W", auto-scale?)
- Should the ± boxes animate on first population (the moment they stop being empty)?
- Can the superscript/subscript system eventually show different relevant information based on context?
