# AGENTS.md — PPL± Codex Operating Instructions

You are working inside the PPL± repository.

## What This Project Is

PPL± is a semantic training language (SCL — Semantic Compression Language) built by Jake Berry.
It uses 61 emojis across 7 categories to produce 1,680 unique workout addresses called zip codes.
Each zip code is a 4-emoji address that fully specifies a workout's loading protocol, exercise
character, muscle groups, and equipment format.

This repository is the master source of truth for all 1,680 workouts.

**Current phase:** Phase 2 — Workout Generation
**Status:** Deck 07 (⛽🏛 Strength Basics) complete — 40/1,680 cards generated. 1,640 remaining.
**Active task:** See `whiteboard.md`.

**Do not freelance. Read `whiteboard.md` before acting.**

### Downstream architecture

The `.md` card files are master blueprints for a web application.

`.md card → HTML workout card → user interactive session → user history → personal exercise database`

A hallucinated exercise in a `.md` file propagates through the entire downstream pipeline.
**Content accuracy is the highest priority constraint in this repository.**
When in doubt about an exercise or parameter, do not guess. Flag it.

## The 4-Dial Zip Code System

Every workout is a 4-emoji address. Format: **ORDER AXIS TYPE COLOR**

```
Position 1: ORDER  (7)  — Load ceiling. Training phase. The law.
Position 2: AXIS   (6)  — Exercise character. Selection bias.
Position 3: TYPE   (5)  — Muscle groups. Movement domain.
Position 4: COLOR  (8)  — Equipment tier. Session format.
```

Total combinations: 7 × 6 × 5 × 8 = **1,680 zip codes**

**Constraint hierarchy when dials conflict:**
1. ORDER — Hard ceiling. Nothing exceeds it. Ever.
2. COLOR — Hard filter. Equipment is binary.
3. AXIS — Soft bias. Ranks exercises, does not exclude.
4. Equipment — Practical filter. What is actually available.

### ORDERS (7) — The Loading Protocol

| Emoji | Name | Load | Reps | Rest | Max Difficulty | CNS |
|-------|------|------|------|------|----------------|-----|
| 🐂 | Foundation | ≤65% | 8–15 | 60–90s | 2/5 | Low |
| ⛽ | Strength | 75–85% | 4–6 | 3–4 min | 4/5 | High |
| 🦋 | Hypertrophy | 65–75% | 8–12 | 60–90s | 3/5 | Moderate |
| 🏟 | Performance | 85–100%+ | 1–3 | Full | 5/5 | High |
| 🌾 | Full Body | ~70% | 8–10 | 30–90s | 3/5 | Moderate |
| ⚖ | Balance | ~70% | 10–12 | 90s | 3/5 | Moderate |
| 🖼 | Restoration | ≤55% | 12–15 | 60s | 2/5 | Low |

**Order notes:**
- 🐂 Foundation: Pattern learning at sub-maximal load. Not beginner-only. Ceiling: if load >65%, reps <8, or difficulty >2, it is not 🐂.
- ⛽ Strength: Neural adaptation. Heavy loads, low reps, full recovery. Force production. Not bodybuilding.
- 🦋 Hypertrophy: Muscle growth through volume and metabolic stress. The pump matters.
- 🏟 Performance: Testing, not training. Test, record, leave. No junk volume. 3–4 blocks only.
- 🌾 Full Body: Integration. Flow and Unity Test is mandatory — each movement flows into the next, forming a single unified pattern.
- ⚖ Balance: Correction. Microscope on weak links and asymmetries.
- 🖼 Restoration: Recovery without training debt. You leave fresher than you entered. Extended scope: somatic movement, TRE, pelvic floor, diaphragmatic breathing, nervous system regulation.

### TYPES (5) — The Muscle Groups

| Emoji | Name | Muscles | Primary Patterns |
|-------|------|---------|-----------------|
| 🛒 | Push | Chest, front delts, triceps | Horizontal press, vertical press |
| 🪡 | Pull | Lats, rear delts, biceps, traps, erectors | Row, pulldown, hinge |
| 🍗 | Legs | Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves | Squat, lunge, hinge, isolation |
| ➕ | Plus | Full body power, core | Olympic lifts, carries, plyometrics, anti-rot |
| ➖ | Ultra | Cardiovascular system | Rowing, cycling, running, conditioning, flows |

### AXES (6) — Exercise Character and Selection Bias

| Emoji | Name | Character |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 🏛 | Basics (Firmitas) | Bilateral, stable, time-tested fundamentals. Barbell classics first. Priority: Barbell > dumbbell. Bilateral > unilateral. Compound > isolation. |
| 🔨 | Functional (Utilitas) | Unilateral, standing, athletic-transfer. Priority: Unilateral > bilateral. Standing > seated. Free weight > machine. |
| 🌹 | Aesthetic (Venustas) | Isolation, full ROM, mind-muscle connection. Feel over load. In 🖼: somatic lens — pelvic floor, psoas, diaphragm, deep hip. |
| 🪐 | Challenge (Gravitas) | Hardest variation at any level. Deficit, pause, tempo, bands, chains, unstable surfaces. Always the hardest version they can control. |
| ⌛ | Time (Temporitas) | Context axis enabling EMOM, AMRAP, density blocks, timed sets, time trials, TUT, steady state. Specific protocol from Order × Color. |
| 🐬 | Partner (Sociatas) | Context axis enabling spottable, alternating, synchronized, competitive, assisted, station rotation. Machine work deprioritized. |

Full character specifications for each Axis are in `scl-directory.md`.

### COLORS (8) — Equipment and Session Format

Equipment Tiers:
- Tier 0: Bodyweight only
- Tier 1: Bands, sliders, rollers
- Tier 2: Dumbbells, kettlebells, plates
- Tier 3: Barbell, rack, bench
- Tier 4: Machines, cables
- Tier 5: Specialty (stones, sleds, GHD, competition equipment)

**THE GOLD RULE:** Only 🔴 Intense and 🟣 Technical unlock GOLD exercises.
GOLD = Olympic lifts, advanced plyometrics, spinal-loaded ballistics.
All other colors block GOLD regardless of Order.

| Emoji | Name | Tier | GOLD | Character |
|-------|------|------|------|-----------|
| ⚫ | Teaching | 2–3 | No | Extra rest, coaching cues, comprehension over exertion |
| 🟢 | Bodyweight | 0–2 | No | No gym required. Park, hotel, living room. |
| 🔵 | Structured | 2–3 | No | Prescribed sets/reps/rest. Trackable. Repeatable. |
| 🟣 | Technical | 2–5 | Yes | Precision. Lower volume, extended rest, quality focus. |
| 🔴 | Intense | 2–4 | Yes | Maximum effort. High volume. Reduced rest. Supersets OK. |
| 🟠 | Circuit | 0–3 | No | Station-based timed rotation. No barbells. Loop logic required. |
| 🟡 | Fun | 0–5 | No | Exploration and variety. Structured play within constraints. |
| ⚪ | Mindful | 0–3 | No | Slow tempo (4s eccentrics). Extended rest (2+ min). Breath. |

🟠 Circuit loop logic: Every station must change which tissue is working. No two adjacent stations target the same muscle group.

---

## The ± Operator Layer

After the zip code, the ± bridges to an operator — a Latin-derived verb setting session intent.
The operator derives from Axis × Color polarity.

Polarity split:
- **Preparatory Colors (inhale):** ⚫ Teaching, 🟢 Bodyweight, ⚪ Mindful, 🟡 Fun
- **Expressive Colors (exhale):** 🔵 Structured, 🟣 Technical, 🔴 Intense, 🟠 Circuit

**Default Operator Table:**

| Axis | Preparatory (⚫🟢⚪🟡) | Expressive (🔵🟣🔴🟠) |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 📍 pono (place/position) | 🤌 facio (execute/perform) |
| 🔨 Funct. | 🧸 fero (carry/transfer) | 🥨 tendo (extend/push limits) |
| 🌹 Aesth. | 👀 specio (inspect/observe) | 🦢 plico (fold/superset/layer) |
| 🪐 Chall. | 🪵 teneo (hold/anchor/persist) | 🚀 mitto (dispatch/deploy/launch) |
| ⌛ Time | 🐋 duco (orchestrate/conduct) | ✒️ grapho (write/prescribe/document) |
| 🐬 Partner | 🧲 capio (receive/assess/intake) | 🦉 logos (reason/analyze/interpret) |

The coach can override the default operator. Honor the override.

## Blocks (22 Session Containers)

Blocks are rooms inside a workout. The name is fixed. The content shifts by zip code.

**Four operational functions:**
- Orientation — Arriving, focusing, pointing intent
- Access/Preparation — Mobility, activation, priming
- Transformation — Where capacity is built or tested
- Retention/Transfer — Locking in, cooling down, bridging forward

| Emoji | Name | Role | Notes |
|-------|------|------|-------|
| ♨️ | Warm-Up | Orientation/Access | Always present. Always first (unless 🎯 opens). Content shifts by Order. |
| 🎯 | Intention | Orientation | One sentence. Quoted. Active voice. Frame the work, don't hype it. |
| 🔢 | Fundamentals | Access | Re-grounding in basics. Post-injury, post-layoff, teaching contexts. |
| 🧈 | Bread/Butter | Transformation | The main thing. Always present. Most volume. Most stimulus. |
| 🫀 | Circulation | Access | Blood flow, tissue prep. Early or mid-session. |
| ▶️ | Primer | Access | CNS activation. Bridges warm-up to main work. Neural potentiation. |
| 🎼 | Composition | Transformation | Movement arrangement. Strong in 🌾 Full Body. Composite header block. |
| ♟️ | Gambit | Access | Deliberate sacrifice for positional advantage. Pre-fatigue with purpose. |
| 🪜 | Progression | Access/Transform | Loading ramps. Ladders. In 🏟: the ramp to the test. |
| 🌎 | Exposure | Transformation | Reveal weaknesses under controlled stress. Expand movement vocabulary. |
| 🎱 | ARAM | Transformation | Station-based loops. Loop logic required. Box notation in markdown. |
| 🌋 | Gutter | Transformation | All-out effort. Rare. Only in 🔴 and 🪐. Never in 🖼, 🐂, or ⚪. |
| 🪞 | Vanity | Transformation | Appearance-driven. Pump work. Mirror muscles. Honest. Stigma-free. |
| 🗿 | Sculpt | Transformation | Hypertrophy shaping. Angles, tension, volume. Carving not admiring. |
| 🛠 | Craft | Transformation | Skill acquisition. Quality over load. Filters toward ⚫ and 🟣. |
| 🧩 | Supplemental | Transformation | Secondary work. Supports 🧈. Must be non-redundant. Different angles. |
| 🪫 | Release | Retention | Context-dependent: 🔴 = stress OUT. ⚪ = tension DOWN. 🖼 = return to baseline. |
| 🏖 | Sandbox | Transformation | Constrained exploration. 🟡 = play. ⚫ = safe learning. 🟣 = skill testing. |
| 🏗 | Reformance | Transformation | Corrective construction. Prehab, postural correction. Prominent in ⚖. |
| 🧬 | Imprint | Retention | Locking in patterns. High rep, low load, late session. Neural memory. |
| 🚂 | Junction | Retention | Bridge to next session. 1–3 follow-up zip codes with rationale. Logging space. |
| 🔠 | Choice | Modifier | Bounded autonomy. Applies to other blocks. Options must be valid for the code. |

System block:
| 🧮 | SAVE | Closing | Session complete. Log data. Archive. Every workout ends here. |

### Block sequence guidelines by Order

## Generation Rules

Execute these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

**Step 1 — Parse the Zip Code**
Extract all four dials. Load all parameter ceilings and constraints.
- Order → load ceiling, rep range, rest periods, max difficulty, CNS demand
- Axis → exercise selection bias, paired operators, exercise character
- Type → muscle groups, movement patterns
- Color → equipment tier, GOLD access, session format, structural rules

**Step 2 — Derive the Default Operator**
Read the Axis (position 2) and the Color (position 4).
Check the polarity table above. Preparatory Colors → first operator. Expressive Colors → second operator.
If the coach overrides the operator, honor the override.

**Step 3 — Derive the Block Sequence**
Use the Order × Color guidelines. Select the appropriate blocks. Count must match Order guidelines.
Apply Color modifiers on top.

**Step 4 — Select Exercises**
Every exercise must satisfy ALL FOUR dials simultaneously:
- Within Order's load ceiling and difficulty cap
- Matching Axis bias (rank accordingly, do not exclude)
- Training the Type's muscle groups and movement patterns
- Using only equipment within the Color's tier range
- GOLD exercises only if Color is 🔴 or 🟣
- **All exercises must exist in `exercise-library.md` — no exceptions**

**Step 5 — Format the Workout**
Use the SCL markdown format. All 15 required elements must be present.

---

## Required Format Elements

All 15 must be present in every generated card:

1. Title with flanking Type emojis
2. Subtitle: training modality, targets, honest time estimate
3. CODE line: the 4-dial zip code
4. 🎯 INTENTION: quoted, one sentence, active voice, direct
5. Numbered BLOCKS with emoji names and heavy border separators (═══)
6. At least one Operator call inline after a block header
7. Sub-block zip codes: BLOCK+TYPE+AXIS+COLOR format with parenthetical expansion: (Block | Muscle | Bias | Equipment)
8. Tree notation: ├─ for containment, │ for continuation
9. Reps before exercise name: "10 🍗 Squat" not "🍗 Squat × 10"
10. Type emoji before exercise name: "🪡 Deadlift"
11. Cues in parentheses, 3–6 words, conversational: "(slow, feel the stretch)"
12. Sets on individual lines with Order emoji: "Set 1: ⛽ 80% × 5 (context)"
13. Rest specified for every block
14. 🚂 JUNCTION with logging space and next-session bridge. Include 1–3 suggested follow-up zip codes with rationale. Format: `Next → [zip] — [one-line reason]`
15. 🧮 SAVE with closing principle (1–2 sentences)

---

## Tonal Rules

These are not suggestions. They are constraints.

- Direct, not flowery
- Technical but human
- Conversational cues, not clinical jargon
- No motivational filler. No "You got this!" No "Crush it today!"
- No clinical language. No "optimize neuromuscular recruitment"
- Yes to "Hips back, not down." Yes to "Hold the weight in the bottom."
- 🎯 Intention: frame the work, do not hype it
- 🧮 SAVE closing principle: transfer the work, do not praise the user
- The workout speaks to a competent adult who does not need to be managed

---

## Common Generation Errors

**🪫 Release is not always a cool-down.** Direction depends entirely on context.
- 🔴 context = cathartic discharge, stress OUT
- ⚪ context = parasympathetic downregulation, tension DOWN
- 🖼 context = somatic return to baseline

**🌹 Aesthetic is not always isolation work.** In 🖼 Restoration context, the lens turns inward:
pelvic floor, psoas, diaphragm, deep hip structures. The aesthetic lens becomes somatic.
Do not assign cable curls to 🖼🌹.

**🧈 Bread & Butter is not always a heavy lift.**
- In 🏟 it is the test itself.
- In 🖼 it is the main mobility or somatic sequence.
- In ⚖ it is targeted accessory compounds addressing the specific gap.
The block name is fixed. The content shifts entirely by Order.

**⛽🟢 Bodyweight Strength is not a rest day and not a beginner workout.**
It is the check valve — does your gym strength transfer outside the gym?
Advanced calisthenics apply: muscle-ups, pistol squats, planche progressions, L-sits, archer push-ups.
The Order ceiling still applies to difficulty.

**🏟 Performance has 3–4 blocks only. No exceptions. No junk volume.**
Test. Record. Leave. That is the complete session.

**🌾 Full Body is not a superset. It is integration.**
Each movement must flow into the next without a reset.
The result must be a single unified pattern, not a sequence of movements.
If you would call it a superset, it does not belong in 🌾.

## Validation Checklist

Before writing any workout to a file, verify all of the following.
If any check fails, revise before writing.

**Order compliance:**
- [ ] Load stays at or below Order ceiling
- [ ] Rep ranges match Order parameters
- [ ] Rest periods match Order parameters
- [ ] Difficulty stays at or below Order maximum
- [ ] Block count matches Order guidelines

**Type accuracy:**
- [ ] Exercises train the correct muscle groups
- [ ] Movement patterns match the Type

**Axis character:**
- [ ] Exercise selection reflects the Axis bias
- [ ] Would someone feel the Axis without being told?

**Color constraints:**
- [ ] All equipment within Color's tier range
- [ ] No barbells in 🟢 or 🟠
- [ ] GOLD exercises only in 🔴 or 🟣
- [ ] Loop logic applied in 🟠 Circuit

**Full Body integrity (🌾 only):**
- [ ] Flow test: Does each movement flow into the next without a reset?
- [ ] Unity test: Is the result a single unified pattern, not a sequence?
- [ ] Both must pass.

**Block structure:**
- [ ] 🧈 Bread & Butter is present and carries most volume
- [ ] Session flows Orient → Access → Transform → Retain

## File Naming Convention

**Stub (awaiting generation):**
`[zip]±.md`
Example: `⛽🏛🪡🔵±.md`

**Complete (workout generated):**
`[zip]±[operator emoji] [Workout Title].md`
Example: `⛽🏛🪡🔵±🤌 Heavy Classic Pulls.md`

The ± is the hinge point.
- Left of ± — machine-readable zip code address
- Right of ± — operator emoji + human-readable workout title

**Status markers in frontmatter:**
- `status: EMPTY` — stub file, awaiting workout generation
- `status: GENERATED` — workout written, pending review
- `status: CANONICAL` — reviewed and approved by Jake Berry

When you generate a workout, rename the stub file to the complete filename as part of the same commit.
Update frontmatter: `status: EMPTY` → `status: GENERATED`.

---

## What You Do Not Do

- Do not invent exercises that are not in `exercise-library.md`
- Do not exceed Order load ceilings under any circumstances
- Do not use GOLD exercises in non-GOLD colors
- Do not use barbells in 🟢 Bodyweight or 🟠 Circuit workouts
- Do not add motivational language or praise the user
- Do not generate junk volume in 🏟 Performance workouts
- Do not place 🌋 Gutter in 🖼 Restoration, 🐂 Foundation, or ⚪ Mindful workouts
- Do not treat supersets as valid in non-🔴 contexts unless specified
- Do not generate a workout without running the full validation checklist
- Do not modify files outside the scope of the current task
- Do not freelance between sessions. Read `whiteboard.md` first.

---

## Review guidelines

When reviewing PRs for SCL compliance (triggered with `@codex review`):

**Verify all of the following:**
- All exercises exist in `exercise-library.md`
- Order load ceilings are not exceeded
- GOLD exercises only appear with 🔴 or 🟣 colors
- No barbells in 🟢 Bodyweight or 🟠 Circuit
- No motivational filler or clinical jargon in tone
- All 15 required format elements are present
- Block count matches Order guidelines
- 🟠 Circuit cards have proper loop logic (no adjacent stations targeting same muscle group)
- 🏟 Performance cards have 3–4 blocks only with no junk volume
- 🌾 Full Body cards pass the Flow test and Unity test

**Flag only:**
- P0 — Hard constraint violations (exercise not in library, load ceiling exceeded, GOLD in wrong color, barbell in 🟢/🟠, 🏟 with >4 blocks)
- P1 — Exercise/format accuracy issues (missing required elements, tonal rule violations, block count out of range)

Do not flag style preferences. Do not flag P2 or lower.
