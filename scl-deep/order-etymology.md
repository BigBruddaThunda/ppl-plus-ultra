  The 7 Orders carry architectural names from classical and Renaissance building traditions.
  These names are not decorations. They encode the visual identity, structural character,
  and tonal register of each training phase. This document specifies the etymological and
  architectural heritage of each Order and its mapping to training intent.

# ORDER ETYMOLOGY
## The Architectural Heritage of the 7 PPL± Orders

The 7 Orders are not named arbitrarily. Each name is borrowed from a classical or Renaissance architectural tradition that shares the structural and tonal character of that training phase. When PPL± renders workout cards in HTML, these architectural identities drive the visual language — typography weight, column structure, decorative density, material texture.

The architecture is the training.

## THE CLASSICAL ORDERS IN ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY

The classical architectural orders originated in ancient Greece and Rome. Each order governs column proportions, capital decoration, entablature structure, and the overall character of a building. They are not merely stylistic — they encode structural principles, cultural values, and proportional mathematics.

The five canonical classical orders, from simplest to most ornate:
1. Tuscan — Roman simplification of Doric. Unfluted, plain capital.
2. Doric — The oldest Greek order. Austere, strong, minimal.
3. Ionic — Graceful, voluted capital. Between austerity and ornament.
4. Corinthian — Elaborate acanthus-leaf capital. Maximum ornamentation.
5. Composite — Roman hybrid of Ionic and Corinthian. Synthesis.

PPL± extends this to 7 by adding:
6. Vitruvian — Named for Vitruvius, the Roman author of *De Architectura*, who formalized the proportional system underlying all classical orders.
7. Palladian — Andrea Palladio's Renaissance refinement: symmetry, classical vocabulary, and return to pure proportion.

## THE 7 ORDERS — FULL ETYMOLOGY

### 🐂 FOUNDATION — Tuscan

**Architectural origin:** The Tuscan order was Roman — a simplified descendant of Doric. Unfluted shaft. Plain, unmolded capital. No decoration. It was the practical choice: faster to build, easier to maintain, structurally reliable. The Tuscan column does not show off. It holds weight.

**Etymology:** From *Tuscia*, the Latin name for Etruria (modern Tuscany). The Etruscans preceded Rome and were known for plain, functional building. Rome inherited the Tuscan column as the workman's choice — honest structure without pretension.

**Training mapping:** Foundation is the Tuscan of training. Sub-maximal load (≤65% 1RM). 8–15 reps. 60–90 second rest. Max difficulty: 2/5. The goal is pattern installation, not performance. The Tuscan column does not show off. It works. A 20-year veteran learning Olympic lifting uses Foundation. The order is not about beginner status — it is about honest acknowledgment that this pattern is not yet owned.

**Visual character (HTML):** Plain serif. Unadorned card structure. No drop shadows. No texture. The card reads like a clean blueprint.

---

### ⛽ STRENGTH — Doric

**Architectural origin:** The Doric is the oldest Greek order and the most austere. Columns without fluting, or with shallow fluting. The capital is a plain circle (echinus) topped by a flat slab (abacus). No volutes. No acanthus leaves. Just structural honesty and weight-bearing capacity. The Parthenon is Doric. It does not need ornament to be monumental.

**Etymology:** From the *Dorians*, the Greek-speaking people who migrated into Greece around 1100 BCE and built the tradition's foundational structures. The Dorian mode in music is similarly austere — minor, direct, without embellishment.

**Training mapping:** Strength is the Doric of training. 75–85% 1RM. 4–6 reps. 3–4 minutes rest. CNS demand: high. The session is austere by design — heavy, minimal, complete. There is no pump. There is no metabolic stress. There is the bar and the load and the neural signal. Force production. Neural adaptation. The Parthenon lifts heavy.

**Visual character (HTML):** Heavy weight type. Minimal ornamentation. Strong horizontal rule separators. The card has structural gravity. It does not need decoration to communicate its weight.

---

### 🦋 HYPERTROPHY — Ionic

**Architectural origin:** The Ionic order introduced the volute — the scroll-like decoration at the top of the capital. More slender than Doric, with a fluted shaft and a base below the column. The Ionic was associated with the Ionian coast — Ephesus, Miletus, Didyma — and with femininity, elegance, and cultural refinement. The Erechtheion in Athens is Ionic. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was Ionic.

**Etymology:** From *Ionia*, the coastal region of western Anatolia (modern Turkey) settled by Greek colonists. Ionian culture was known for philosophy, art, and sophistication — Heraclitus, Anaximander, and Pythagoras all came from Ionian cities.

**Training mapping:** Hypertrophy is the Ionic of training. 65–75% 1RM. 8–12 reps. 60–90 second rest. Metabolic stress and mechanical tension both active. The volume accumulates. The pump is real and welcome. There is more going on than Doric — more sets, more exercises, more time under tension. The session is full and elegant, like a fluted column. The goal is tissue growth, not neural recruitment.

**Visual character (HTML):** Voluted decorative elements at card edges. Richer color treatment. More content visible per card. The card breathes differently than Doric — there is more in it.

---

### 🏟 PERFORMANCE — Corinthian

**Architectural origin:** The Corinthian order is the most ornate of the classical orders. The capital erupts with acanthus leaves, cauliculi (small tendrils), and floral rosettes. The columns are tall and slender. Corinthian was associated with civic grandeur, public monuments, theaters, and temples dedicated to gods associated with achievement. The Pantheon's porch is Corinthian. The Temple of Jupiter Olympius in Athens is Corinthian.

**Etymology:** Named for the city of Corinth, the wealthy, cosmopolitan port city of ancient Greece. Corinth was known for its wealth, its competitive games (the Isthmian Games, second only to Olympia), and its architectural ambition. The Corinthian order emerged from a culture that competed at the highest level and built accordingly.

**Training mapping:** Performance is the Corinthian of training. 85–100%+ 1RM. 1–3 reps. Full recovery (5–8+ minutes). CNS demand: maximum. Difficulty ceiling: 5/5. This is the test, not the training. Maximum voluntary contraction. The PR attempt. The competition lift. The performance audit. Like the Corinthian column, it demands the most — and delivers a specific kind of grandeur no other order can produce.

**The critical rule:** 🏟 has 3–4 blocks only. No junk volume after the test. You test. You record. You leave. The Corinthian temple does not have a storage room attached.

**Visual character (HTML):** Maximum visual weight on the achievement. Bold data fields for the test result. Minimal surrounding content — everything clears the space for the performance number.

### 🌾 FULL BODY — Composite

**Architectural origin:** The Composite order was Roman. It combined the Ionic volute with the Corinthian acanthus leaf capital — a hybrid of two existing traditions synthesized into something new. The Arch of Titus in Rome is Composite. The order acknowledges that full expression sometimes requires borrowing from multiple traditions simultaneously and making something coherent from them.

**Etymology:** From the Latin *compositus* — put together, assembled from parts. The Roman synthesis of Greek precedents into a unified architectural vocabulary.

**Training mapping:** Full Body is the Composite of training. ~70% 1RM. 8–10 reps. 30–90 second rest. Integration — movements must flow into each other without reset. The session borrows from multiple movement domains simultaneously and synthesizes them into a single unified pattern. A thruster is Composite: squat becomes press becomes one thing. A clean-and-jerk is Composite. If you would call it a superset, it does not belong in Full Body — it is two exercises pretending to be one.

**The flow and unity test is mandatory:** Does one movement flow into the next without a reset? Is the result a single unified pattern? Both must pass.

**Visual character (HTML):** Flow-based visual language. Exercises shown as progressions, not lists. The card communicates continuity and integration.

### ⚖ BALANCE — Vitruvian

**Architectural origin:** Marcus Vitruvius Pollio wrote *De Architectura* in the first century BCE — the only complete surviving architectural treatise from antiquity. Vitruvius formalized three principles of good architecture: *firmitas* (strength/durability), *utilitas* (usefulness/function), *venustas* (beauty/grace). He also documented the proportional mathematics underlying all classical orders. Vitruvian is not one of the five classical orders — it refers to the systematic, analytical, proportional tradition that governs them all.

**Etymology:** From *Vitruvius*. The name derives from the Latin *vitrum* (glass) — though the connection is uncertain. What is certain: Vitruvius was the first to write down what everyone else was building, and in doing so created the standard against which all classical buildings were measured.

**The Vitruvian figure:** Leonardo da Vinci's *Uomo Vitruviano* (1490) is the most famous application of Vitruvius — the human body inscribed in a circle and square, demonstrating that perfect proportion is measurable and replicable. The image is about systematic measurement of what exists, not creation of something new.

**Training mapping:** Balance is the Vitruvian of training. ~70% 1RM. 10–12 reps. 90 second rest. The systematic correction of imbalances and asymmetries. Where other orders build, Balance measures. Where other orders load, Balance calibrates. The Vitruvian lens is the microscope: what is the actual proportion between biceps and triceps, left and right, anterior and posterior? The correction map is specific: ⚖🛒 = triceps, side delts, front delts. ⚖🪡 = biceps, rear delts, forearms, grip. ⚖🍗 = calves, adductors, tibialis. ⚖➕ = rotational stability, anti-rotation. ⚖➖ = energy system gaps, aerobic base.

**Visual character (HTML):** Split-panel layout. Left vs. right. Before vs. target. Measurement fields prominent. The card communicates correction, not accumulation.

### 🖼 RESTORATION — Palladian

**Architectural origin:** Andrea Palladio (1508–1580) was the most influential architect of the Renaissance. His *I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura* (Four Books on Architecture, 1570) systematized the classical vocabulary while insisting on symmetry, natural light, and mathematical proportion. Palladio's buildings feel calm. They are neither austere like Doric nor exuberant like Corinthian. They are whole. The Villa Rotonda. The Basilica Palladiana. The San Giorgio Maggiore. Architecture that restores the viewer. The Palladian style spread across Europe and into colonial America — it became the language of rationality, balance, and ordered calm.

**Etymology:** From *Palladio* (born Andrea di Pietro della Gondola). The name Palladio was given to him by his patron, the humanist Gian Giorgio Trissino, after *Pallas Athena* — the goddess of wisdom and craft. The name encodes the project: building as wisdom made physical.

**Training mapping:** Restoration is the Palladian of training. ≤55% 1RM. 12–15 reps. 60 second rest (or intuitive). CNS demand: low. The session restores — it never adds training debt. You leave fresher than you entered. The Palladian principle is symmetry and calm, not austerity. There is beauty in Palladian work — it is intentional and refined, not blank. Restoration sessions are not easy. They are deliberate.

**Extended scope:** somatic movement, TRE (tension and trauma releasing exercises), pelvic floor, deep hip work, diaphragmatic breathing, nervous system regulation. 🖼 + 🌹 + ⚪ = the deepest recovery lane in the system.

**Visual character (HTML):** Soft typography. Generous white space. Muted palette. The card feels like the room it describes. It does not compete for attention.

## THE ARCHITECTURAL FAMILY TREE

```
ANCIENT GREECE
├── Doric ────────────────── ⛽ Strength
└── Ionic ────────────────── 🦋 Hypertrophy

ANCIENT ROME (classical synthesis)
├── Tuscan (simplified Doric) ── 🐂 Foundation
├── Corinthian (civic grandeur) ─ 🏟 Performance
└── Composite (Ionic + Corinthian) 🌾 Full Body

CLASSICAL THEORY
└── Vitruvian (proportional system) ⚖ Balance

RENAISSANCE
└── Palladian (return to proportion) 🖼 Restoration
```

The tree maps the Orders historically. Tuscan derives from Doric. Composite synthesizes Ionic and Corinthian. Vitruvius formalized what the Greeks built. Palladio refined what Rome formalized. The progression is not simple to complex — it is a complete rotation through a full architectural tradition and back to intentional clarity.

🐂 Foundation (Tuscan) and 🖼 Restoration (Palladian) are aesthetic opposites — plain vs. refined — but share the principle of essentials only. The training year often begins in Tuscan and closes in Palladian. The architecture says the same thing without being told.

## OPEN QUESTIONS

- Should each Order have an explicit color palette, typographic scale, and material texture mapped in this document? Currently these are described as visual character notes — they need formal design tokens for HTML implementation.
- Are there other architectural traditions worth mapping for potential system expansion? Byzantine? Modernist? Islamic? The current 7 cover the Western classical tradition. The system could extend without breaking the existing structure.
- Does the architectural naming surface in user-facing copy? The experience layer might expose only the training names (Foundation, Strength, etc.) and keep the architectural names as the design system's internal vocabulary.
- Should the Vitruvian three principles — *firmitas, utilitas, venustas* — map explicitly onto three of the Axes (🏛 Basics = firmitas, 🔨 Functional = utilitas, 🌹 Aesthetic = venustas)? This connection already exists in the Axis naming but is not formally stated.
