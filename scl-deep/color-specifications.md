# SCL Color Specifications — Deep Reference

## Preamble: The Human Dial

The Color is the fourth position in the 4-dial zip code. It is also the most personal.

Order is set by the day of the week. Type is set by a rolling 5-day calendar. Axis is set by the month and its operator. The user does not choose any of these — the system derives them from the date. They are the building, the floor, the wing.

Color is the room the user enters. The user chooses this.

It is the only dial that requires a decision. Everything else in the zip code is determined before the user opens the app. The Color is where the system asks: what do you need today? Heavy and structured? Light and exploratory? Technical and precise? Mindful and slow?

This is not free choice. The system still constrains. Color sets equipment tier, GOLD gate, block structure, and operator polarity. But within those constraints, the user is choosing the quality of the session — the register it lives in, the energy it draws from, the kind of demand it places.

**Why Color is last:** The other three dials define what the workout IS — what phase you're in, what you're training, how you're selecting exercises. Color defines how you're going to be in it. It frames the other three. The room sets the mood for the work inside it.

**The two dual identities of each Color:**

Every Color carries two simultaneous names:
- **Operational name** — what it does in workout generation (Teaching, Bodyweight, Structured, Technical, Intense, Circuit, Fun, Mindful)
- **Tonal name** — what it communicates as a register (Order, Growth, Planning, Magnificence, Passion, Connection, Play, Eudaimonia)

Both are true. The emoji holds both. A workout card filed at 🔴 is Intense as a session format AND Passion as a tonal register. These are not two separate systems — they are the same thing at different zoom levels. Intensity in the gym is passion in the body.

### The Polarity Split: Inhale and Exhale

The 8 Colors divide into two poles of four:

**Preparatory Colors — the inhale:**
⚫ Teaching | 🟢 Bodyweight | ⚪ Mindful | 🟡 Fun

These Colors gather. They learn, explore, recover, play. The user is receiving — receiving instruction, receiving space, receiving variety. The session moves inward before it moves out. These Colors trigger the first operator in each Axis pair — the positioning, carrying, inspecting, holding, orchestrating, receiving operators.

**Expressive Colors — the exhale:**
🔵 Structured | 🟣 Technical | 🔴 Intense | 🟠 Circuit

These Colors execute. They produce, test, perform, and rotate at full output. The user is expressing — expressing what they know, what they can lift, what their body does under load. These Colors trigger the second operator in each Axis pair — the executing, extending, layering, launching, documenting, reasoning operators.

The breath metaphor is not decorative. Inhale before exhale. Gather before express. Any trained athlete knows this. The polarity split formalizes it.

---

## The GOLD Rule

GOLD exercises are gated to two Colors only: **🔴 Intense** and **🟣 Technical**.

**What GOLD means:** Olympic lifts (clean, snatch, jerk, and their variations), advanced plyometrics (depth drops, weighted box jumps, hurdle drills), and spinal-loaded ballistics (stone lifts, tire flips, log press). These exercises require precise technical foundations to execute safely at any meaningful load. They are not categorically harder than non-GOLD exercises — a heavy barbell squat at ⛽ is more demanding than a power clean at 🐂. GOLD designates a specific KIND of technical complexity: ballistic acceleration, elastic loading, or loaded instability under high velocity.

**Why GOLD is gated:** The gate is not about ability. It is about context. 🔴 Intense is already the high-CNS, max-effort register — GOLD exercises belong in an environment that's already at full output. 🟣 Technical is already the precision-and-quality register — GOLD exercises belong in an environment where load is secondary to execution. Both Colors provide the right container.

Teaching colors (⚫) use coaching cues and extended rest — but GOLD exercises in a teaching context create a misleading frame. The point of GOLD is not to learn it slowly; it's to do it with proper architecture under appropriate conditions. Foundation sessions that build toward GOLD use non-GOLD progressions (Romanian deadlifts before cleans, box jumps before depth drops).

**All other Colors block GOLD regardless of Order.** A 🏟 Performance session at 🟢 Bodyweight does not permit Olympic lifts. A 🪐 Challenge session at 🔵 Structured does not permit plyometric depth drops. The Color is a hard filter. Order does not override Color on GOLD access.

---

## Barbell Constraint Rules

Two Colors exclude barbells entirely:

**🟢 Bodyweight — Tier 0–2 maximum.** No barbells. Barbells are Tier 3. Bodyweight implies no gym — a park, a hotel room, a living room, a field. The constraint is not about avoiding barbells for conceptual reasons; it is about genuine portability. If the session requires a rack and a barbell, it is not a bodyweight session.

**🟠 Circuit — Tier 0–3, but loop logic prohibits barbell use in practice.** Circuit stations must rotate through tissues. Barbell setup (loading plates, adjusting rack height, checking collars) takes 60–90 seconds minimum — time that destroys the flow logic of a circuit. More practically: a circuit with one barbell station cannot rotate the barbell between users or across stations without breaking the loop. Circuit work uses dumbbells, kettlebells, bodyweight, bands, plates, and boxes. The barbell is not the right tool for this format.

**Rationale for the constraint:** The barbell's power comes from specificity, setup, and progressive loading across sessions. Circuit and bodyweight formats derive their value from continuity, portability, and tissue rotation. The barbell belongs in formats that honor it — structured sets, technical precision, strength ramps. Dropping a barbell into a circuit is not an upgrade; it is a format mismatch.

## Alchemical Correspondence

Medieval alchemy described matter moving through four stages of transformation: blackening, whitening, yellowing, and reddening. Nigredo, albedo, citrinitas, rubedo. The progression was chemical — lead toward gold. It was also psychological — the self moving through dissolution toward completion.

The four expressive poles of the Color system map to these stages without force:

**Nigredo — ⚫ Teaching:** The blackening stage is putrefaction — the necessary decomposition before anything new can form. ⚫ is the unglamorous foundation. It is extra rest, coaching cues, comprehension before exertion. Nobody talks about the Teaching session. Nobody posts it. It is the substrate. It is necessary the way that rotting leaves are necessary for the soil that grows everything else.

**Albedo — ⚪ Mindful:** The whitening stage is purification — matter stripped back to its essential form. ⚪ is 4-second eccentrics, breathing cues, 2-minute rest periods. It removes the noise. Slow tempo and extended whitespace are not gentleness for its own sake; they are the conditions required to hear what the body is actually saying. Albedo is honest.

**Citrinitas — 🟡 Fun:** The yellowing stage is the dawning — the first appearance of light after the long dark of nigredo and albedo. 🟡 is exploration, variety, constrained play. It is not the destination; it is the transition. New movement vocabulary, unfamiliar exercises, angles that haven't been tested. The citrinitas stage was considered the most unstable — full of potential, not yet formed. That is exactly what 🟡 feels like. It could be anything.

**Rubedo — 🔴 Intense:** The reddening stage is completion — the full expression of what the work was always building toward. 🔴 is maximum effort, reduced rest, supersets, the Gutter. Not the beginning. The culmination. You do not start with 🔴. You earn it through the other stages.

**The four Colors between these poles** sit in complex correspondences. 🟢 Bodyweight carries its own albedo character — stripping back to what the body can do without any tools. 🔵 Structured carries a secondary nigredo — the serious, methodical foundation that looks unglamorous but builds everything. 🟣 Technical is the closest thing to rubedo without the volume: not maximum output, but maximum quality, which is the other side of the same coin. 🟠 Circuit carries the communal, rotational quality that the alchemists associated with the luna (silver) stage — not the great red completion, but the living circulation of warmth between people.

These correspondences are descriptive, not prescriptive. They explain why the Colors feel the way they feel. They do not change generation rules.

## ⚫ Teaching — Comprehension before exertion

**Equipment:** Tier 2–3 | **GOLD:** No | **Polarity:** Preparatory

### Tonal Register

⚫ Teaching is the Order tonal name: foundational, serious, non-negotiable. Not severe — serious. The person who writes in ⚫ register is not angry; they are certain. They have earned the right to say this is how it is. They explain from bedrock. They give the reader space to absorb before moving on.

In publication: ⚫ frames a non-negotiable standard. "The Order is the law. Nothing exceeds it." The operating instructions document is ⚫ throughout. The rules section of any document defaults to ⚫.

### Session Character

A ⚫ Teaching session feels like being in a room with someone who knows exactly what they're doing and wants to make sure you do too. Extended rest is not laziness — it is intentional. The rest is part of the instruction. You absorb. You apply. You demonstrate. The coach watches.

The session does not feel urgent. It does not feel easy. It feels like a class you are taking seriously because someone believes the content is worth taking seriously.

### Block Sequence Impact

Color modifier on the Order default:
- **+Extended rest** between every set. Comprehension requires space. The rest period is where the learning consolidates.
- **+🛠 Craft emphasis.** Skill acquisition is the mode. The Craft block is where coaching cues live. The teaching session can open with 🛠 instead of 🧈, or run 🛠 before 🧈 as direct preparation.
- **+⚫ Coaching cues throughout.** Every block has annotated technique. Not more cues — better-placed cues.
- Block count holds at Order default. ⚫ does not add blocks; it changes the quality of what's inside them.

### Operator Derivation

⚫ is a Preparatory Color. It triggers the first operator in each Axis pair.

| Axis | This Color's Operator |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 📍 pono — set, place, position |
| 🔨 Functional | 🧸 fero — carry, transfer, channel |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 👀 specio — inspect, observe, monitor |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🪵 teneo — hold, anchor, persist |
| ⌛ Time | 🐋 duco — orchestrate, lead, conduct |
| 🐬 Partner | 🧲 capio — receive, assess, intake |

The preparatory operators are all positional or receptive: placing, carrying, watching, holding, conducting, receiving. These are what a teaching session does. It sets position. It receives the incoming information. It holds the standard while the pattern is being built.

### Equipment Notes

Tier 2–3: dumbbells, kettlebells, plates, barbell, rack, bench. Not tier 0–1 or 4–5. The ⚫ session uses enough equipment to make the movement real, but not so much that equipment management becomes the problem. Teaching sessions benefit from the clarity of a barbell pattern learned correctly — not the novelty of specialty equipment.

No GOLD. Teaching sessions are not the right container for ballistic or Olympic work. GOLD exercises require a foundation that teaching sessions are still building.

### CSS Direction

⚫ carries warm rich black (#1A1A1A range — not pure #000). The UI at this Color should feel like the serious walls of a reading room: substantial, load-bearing, without ornamentation. Block borders in ⚫ are heavier than other Colors. The coaching cue typography has extra whitespace above and below. The visual language communicates: pay attention to this.

### When to Choose This Color

When you are learning something you do not yet know well. When you have returned from a layoff and are rebuilding your movement patterns. When the goal is comprehension — not just completion. The ⚫ session is not about what you can do; it is about what you understand. If you are not learning anything, this is probably not your Color today.

## 🟢 Bodyweight — No gym required

**Equipment:** Tier 0–2 maximum | **GOLD:** No | **Polarity:** Preparatory

### Tonal Register

🟢 Bodyweight is the Growth tonal name: steady, sustainable, consistent, showing up. Not dramatic. Not celebrated. The person who writes in 🟢 register is still here tomorrow. They do not need recognition. They trust that small and real accumulates into something.

In publication: 🟢 frames steady observation and quiet persistence. "February. The ground is frozen but the sap is rising. Trust that." Almanac entries live in 🟢. Check-ins live in 🟢. Consistency reports live in 🟢.

### Session Character

A 🟢 Bodyweight session is a check valve. The question it asks is simple: does your gym strength transfer outside the gym? When there is no barbell, no rack, no cable stack — what remains?

This is not a beginner session. It is not a rest day. A muscle-up is a bodyweight exercise. A pistol squat is a bodyweight exercise. A planche progression is a bodyweight exercise. At ⛽ Order with 🟢 Color, the difficulty ceiling (4/5 max difficulty) still applies — the session is heavy in the CNS sense even with no external load.

The session feels portable. It could happen anywhere. That is not a limitation — it is the point.

### Block Sequence Impact

Color modifier on the Order default:
- **Equipment collapses to Tier 0–2.** Dumbbells and kettlebells are available; barbells are not. Machines and cables are not.
- **No barbells.** Any barbell movement in the default block sequence is replaced with its bodyweight or dumbbell/kettlebell equivalent. Barbell deadlift → single-leg RDL. Barbell bench → push-up variation at difficulty ceiling.
- **Block structure holds at Order default.** 🟢 does not change block count or block names — it changes which exercises live inside them.
- The 🟢 session has a particular relationship with 🌎 Exposure (if permitted by Order): new bodyweight movements, angles unfamiliar from gym training, movements that don't exist in a weight room.

### Operator Derivation

🟢 is a Preparatory Color. It triggers the first operator in each Axis pair.

| Axis | This Color's Operator |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 📍 pono — set, place, position |
| 🔨 Functional | 🧸 fero — carry, transfer, channel |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 👀 specio — inspect, observe, monitor |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🪵 teneo — hold, anchor, persist |
| ⌛ Time | 🐋 duco — orchestrate, lead, conduct |
| 🐬 Partner | 🧲 capio — receive, assess, intake |

The preparatory operators suit the 🟢 register: steadily carrying, positioning, observing. 🟢 does not launch. It does not dispatch. It shows up and does the work that is available.

### Equipment Notes

Tier 0–2 only. This is a hard ceiling, not a preference. Bodyweight (0), bands/sliders/rollers (1), dumbbells/kettlebells/plates (2). No Tier 3 or above.

No GOLD. Olympic lifts and ballistic plyometrics require specific equipment and setups that the 🟢 Color explicitly excludes.

Within Tier 0–2, dumbbells can reach significant loads. A heavy dumbbell Romanian deadlift at ⛽ Order with 🟢 Color is still a serious pulling session. The constraint does not reduce the work; it redirects it.

### CSS Direction

🟢 carries forest green (#3A7D44 range — not lime, not neon). The UI at this Color should feel like a cleared field — open, spacious, nothing extra present. The block structure has generous whitespace. Equipment icons show bands and dumbbells, no racks or cables. The visual language communicates: this works anywhere.

### When to Choose This Color

When you are traveling, or at home, or somewhere without a full gym. When you want to test whether your training lives only in the weight room. When consistency matters more than the specific stimulus. 🟢 is the Color for days when the only question is whether you show up — and the answer is yes.

## 🔵 Structured — Prescribed, trackable, repeatable

**Equipment:** Tier 2–3 | **GOLD:** No | **Polarity:** Expressive

### Tonal Register

🔵 Structured is the Planning tonal name: structured, calm, methodical, processing. The person who writes in 🔵 register gives you the steps in order. They are not exciting. They are reliable. Their prose is traceable — you could follow it the same way twice and get the same result.

In publication: 🔵 frames structured analysis. "Step one, parse the zip code. Step two, derive the operator." The dispatch, the changelog, the generation log — these live in 🔵. Whiteboard entries. Operating notes.

### Session Character

A 🔵 Structured session is the one you can log and repeat. Sets are prescribed. Reps are prescribed. Rest is prescribed. The goal is not discovery — it is execution of a known plan. You know exactly what you are doing before you begin.

This is the most traceable format in the system. Progressive overload is visible. Session-over-session comparison is straightforward. The workout is a prescription, not an experience. That is not a limitation. It is what makes progress measurable.

### Block Sequence Impact

Color modifier on the Order default:
- **+🪜 Progression prominent.** The Structured Color gives 🪜 special weight. Loading ramps — pyramid sets, wave loading, progressive increases — are built into the 🧈 block and sometimes precede it. The prescription is not just "do this weight for these reps" but "start here, move to there."
- **Clean, prescribed structure throughout.** No sandbox exploration, no choice blocks. The Color is the opposite of 🟡: the plan is the plan.
- **Block count at Order default.** 🔵 does not add or remove blocks; it specifies the content inside them with maximum precision.
- Rest periods are exact, not approximate. "90 seconds" not "90–120 seconds." The 🔵 session can be followed like a score.

### Operator Derivation

🔵 is an Expressive Color. It triggers the second operator in each Axis pair.

| Axis | This Color's Operator |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 🤌 facio — execute, perform, produce |
| 🔨 Functional | 🥨 tendo — extend, stretch, push limits |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 🦢 plico — fold, layer, compress |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🚀 mitto — dispatch, deploy, launch |
| ⌛ Time | ✒️ grapho — write, prescribe, document |
| 🐬 Partner | 🦉 logos — reason, analyze, interpret |

The expressive operators align perfectly with the 🔵 register: executing the prescribed plan (facio), extending the established pattern (tendo), documenting the session (grapho), reasoning about load selection (logos). 🔵 is the writing-down Color. The logbook Color.

### Equipment Notes

Tier 2–3: dumbbells, kettlebells, plates, barbell, rack, bench. The Structured session uses the standard gym setup. It does not require specialty equipment, and it does not need to avoid any standard equipment. The prescription is calibrated to what a typical commercial gym provides.

No GOLD. The Structured format is not the right container for Olympic lifts or ballistics — those exercises require the technical attention of 🟣 or the all-out CNS context of 🔴.

### CSS Direction

🔵 carries architectural blue (#2E6BA6 range — not sky blue, not navy). The UI at this Color should feel like a blueprint or a grid: everything in its exact position, labeled, measured. Block borders are precise. Rest timers are prominent. The set/rep notation is displayed with maximum clarity. The visual language communicates: here is exactly what to do.

### When to Choose This Color

When you want a session you can measure. When you are building a training block and need the data to track progress. When exploration is not the goal — execution is. The 🔵 session does not ask you what you feel like doing today. It tells you what is scheduled. That is the point.

## 🟣 Technical — Precision, quality, mastery gates

**Equipment:** Tier 2–5 | **GOLD:** Yes | **Polarity:** Expressive

### Tonal Register

🟣 Technical is the Magnificence tonal name: deep, significant, precise, transformative. The person who writes in 🟣 register has earned the right to be brief. They write fewer words with more weight. The prose is a scalpel. They do not pad, explain unnecessarily, or build up to the point — they are the point.

In publication: 🟣 frames depth and significance. "The Colosseum stacked column orders bottom to top — the Romans built the developmental progression into stone two thousand years ago." Cosmograms live in 🟣. Breakthroughs live in 🟣. The deepest research content lives in 🟣.

### Session Character

A 🟣 Technical session ends when quality degrades. Not when the sets are done — when the quality is gone. This is the distinguishing feature of the Technical format. Volume serves quality. If quality is deteriorating at set 4 of 5, you stop at 4.

The session is characterized by extended rest, lower volume, and focused attention on a narrow set of movements. You might do three things in an entire session. Each of those three things gets the full precision it deserves. You do not rush. You do not accumulate. You isolate and execute with maximum technical fidelity.

This is the only Color besides 🔴 that unlocks GOLD exercises. That is not coincidence. Olympic lifts and advanced plyometrics are GOLD because they demand exactly what 🟣 provides: precision, patience, and the willingness to stop when quality falls.

### Block Sequence Impact

Color modifier on the Order default:
- **Fewer blocks, extended rest.** 🟣 compresses the block count downward from the Order default. Where ⛽ defaults to 5–6 blocks, ⛽🟣 might use 4. The removed volume is not an error — it is intentional. Fewer blocks at higher quality.
- **Quality-focus throughout.** Every exercise in every block has extended rest. 3–4 minutes between sets is common regardless of Order. The Technical Color overrides the default rest if Order's rest is shorter.
- **+🛠 Craft where appropriate.** The Craft block suits 🟣 contexts: deliberate practice, isolated skill acquisition, quality-over-load work.
- **GOLD exercises permitted.** When Type and Order support GOLD movements, 🟣 unlocks them. The session is built around technical execution — GOLD exercises receive the full attention they require.

### Operator Derivation

🟣 is an Expressive Color. It triggers the second operator in each Axis pair.

| Axis | This Color's Operator |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 🤌 facio — execute, perform, produce |
| 🔨 Functional | 🥨 tendo — extend, stretch, push limits |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 🦢 plico — fold, layer, compress |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🚀 mitto — dispatch, deploy, launch |
| ⌛ Time | ✒️ grapho — write, prescribe, document |
| 🐬 Partner | 🦉 logos — reason, analyze, interpret |

The expressive operators at 🟣 carry a precision quality that fits: facio as mastery execution, grapho as meticulous documentation of each set, logos as real-time movement analysis. The 🟣 version of 🤌 facio is not "execute the rep" — it is "execute the rep with everything you know."

### Equipment Notes

Tier 2–5: the full range. Tier 5 (specialty equipment — GHD, competition equipment, specialty bars, sleds) is available here in a way it is not in other Colors. 🟣 Technical is where competition-quality equipment serves the quality mandate. A glute-ham developer, a specialty barbell, a cambered bar — these belong in precision technical work.

GOLD exercises unlocked. When the Order, Type, and Axis call for Olympic lifts or advanced plyometrics, 🟣 is one of the two Colors that can contain them.

### CSS Direction

🟣 carries deep plum (#7B4FA2 range — not electric purple, not lavender). The UI at this Color should feel like something significant is happening: heavier typography, deeper contrast, generous whitespace around each exercise. Quality indicators (form notes, video cue markers) are visually prominent. The visual language communicates: this deserves full attention.

### When to Choose This Color

When the goal is doing it right, not doing it a lot. When you are working on a movement that demands more attention than a standard session provides. When you have the time and the discipline to let quality govern volume. The 🟣 session is for people who would rather leave early having done three things perfectly than stay late having done ten things adequately.

---

## 🔴 Intense — Maximum output, full send

**Equipment:** Tier 2–4 | **GOLD:** Yes | **Polarity:** Expressive

### Tonal Register

🔴 Intense is the Passion tonal name: urgent, intense, high-stakes, direct. The person who writes in 🔴 register does not waste words. The prose moves. Dense rest between ideas — same structure as the session. Pay attention. This matters.

In publication: 🔴 frames urgency. "Test. Record. Leave. That is the complete session." Not anger. Not aggression. Full output — the same energy the session asks for. If something is 🔴 in the publication, it requires action now.

### Session Character

A 🔴 Intense session is maximum effort. High volume, reduced rest (30–60 seconds), supersets and dropsets and giant sets all permitted. The session asks everything you have today, then stops.

This is the rubedo session — the reddening, the full expression. Everything you built in ⚫ (comprehension), 🟢 (consistency), 🔵 (structure), and 🟣 (precision) finds its expression here. You do not start your training career at 🔴. You arrive here.

The session is also the other Color that unlocks GOLD exercises. Where 🟣 unlocks them through precision, 🔴 unlocks them through full CNS engagement. A power clean at 🔴 is performed at maximum velocity with full intent. The GOLD gate exists because ballistic exercises require exactly the full-output context that 🔴 provides.

### Block Sequence Impact

Color modifier on the Order default:
- **🧩 may superset.** Supplemental work can be paired into supersets — two non-competing exercises back to back with minimal rest. This is the only Color where this is permitted by default (outside of coach override).
- **🌋 Gutter possible.** The Gutter block (all-out effort) is gated to 🔴 and 🪐 contexts. It is never present in 🖼, 🐂, or ⚪ workouts. At 🔴, the Gutter is available as a late-session intensity block when the Order and training context support it.
- **🪫 Release is cathartic.** At 🔴, the Release block functions as stress discharge — cathartic output, not parasympathetic downregulation. The direction is OUT, not DOWN.
- **Reduced rest throughout.** 30–60 seconds between sets as a default. Blocks move quickly. The session has a pace.
- **GOLD exercises permitted.** Olympic lifts and advanced plyometrics available when Type and Order support them.

### Operator Derivation

🔴 is an Expressive Color. It triggers the second operator in each Axis pair.

| Axis | This Color's Operator |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 🤌 facio — execute, perform, produce |
| 🔨 Functional | 🥨 tendo — extend, stretch, push limits |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 🦢 plico — fold, layer, compress |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🚀 mitto — dispatch, deploy, launch |
| ⌛ Time | ✒️ grapho — write, prescribe, document |
| 🐬 Partner | 🦉 logos — reason, analyze, interpret |

At 🔴, the expressive operators carry their most forceful meanings: facio as maximum production, mitto as full launch commit, tendo as pushing to the limit of what can be controlled. The 🔴 version of 🚀 mitto is not "dispatch" — it is "commit entirely."

### Equipment Notes

Tier 2–4: dumbbells, kettlebells, plates, barbell, rack, bench, machines, cables. The full standard gym range. Specialty equipment (Tier 5) is not in scope — 🔴 operates in a standard commercial gym environment at full output.

GOLD exercises unlocked. The session is the right container for ballistic work when Order and Type support it.

No barbells in circuit variations. If 🔴 triggers an ARAM-style format through Color × Axis interaction, the circuit constraint applies. But 🔴 is not inherently a circuit Color — it is an intensity Color that happens to permit supersets.

### CSS Direction

🔴 carries deep brick (#C0392B range — not fire engine, not neon red). The UI at this Color should communicate urgency without alarm: compressed whitespace, shorter block descriptions, rest timer prominent and counting down visibly. The Gutter block (when present) has its own visual treatment — heavier border, distinct background. The visual language communicates: move.

### When to Choose This Color

When you have the energy for full output and the training age to use it wisely. When the session calls for maximum effort and the recovery to match. Not every day. Not as a default. 🔴 is earned by the sessions that preceded it. If you are always choosing 🔴, you are either undertrained in the other registers or burning faster than you can recover.

## 🟠 Circuit — Station-based, tissue-rotating, no barbells

**Equipment:** Tier 0–3 | **GOLD:** No | **Polarity:** Expressive

### Tonal Register

🟠 Circuit is the Connection tonal name: warm, relational, inclusive, together. The person who writes in 🟠 register is reaching toward the group. They write for the room, not for one reader. The prose rotates — like a circuit, ideas move through stations, everyone gets served, no single element dominates.

In publication: 🟠 frames community content. "Other people train at this address too. Here is what they noticed." Forum threads, community dispatches, and social content live in 🟠. The warmth is genuine, not performed.

### Session Character

A 🟠 Circuit session is a tissue-rotation loop. Stations change. What was working rests while something else works. The session is structured circulation — not random variety, not a list of exercises done quickly, but a deliberate loop designed so that the work at station 3 actively recovers from what happened at station 2.

The format has a social quality even when done alone. The rotation design implies multiple people moving through together. Circuit work is naturally scalable — load can be adjusted per person at each station without disrupting the loop. It is the most partner-compatible format in the system even before 🐬 Partner axis is introduced.

### Block Sequence Impact

Color modifier on the Order default:
- **🧈/🧩/🪞 merge into 🎱 ARAM with loop logic.** The station-based format replaces the standard linear block structure. The ARAM block (station-based loops) becomes the primary transformation block. Loop logic is mandatory: every station must change which tissue is working. No two adjacent stations target the same muscle group.
- **No barbells.** The loop cannot accommodate barbell setup time. All exercises use tier 0–3 equipment excluding barbells.
- **Block count compresses.** The ARAM format consolidates multiple blocks. The session might be: ♨️ → 🎱 → 🪫 → 🚂. The ARAM carries what would normally be spread across 🧈, 🧩, and supporting blocks.
- **Loop logic is the governing rule.** This is stronger than any other constraint during exercise selection for 🟠. The loop must work as a tissue-rotation system. An exercise that fits Order, Axis, and Type but breaks the loop is not valid.

### Operator Derivation

🟠 is an Expressive Color. It triggers the second operator in each Axis pair.

| Axis | This Color's Operator |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 🤌 facio — execute, perform, produce |
| 🔨 Functional | 🥨 tendo — extend, stretch, push limits |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 🦢 plico — fold, layer, compress |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🚀 mitto — dispatch, deploy, launch |
| ⌛ Time | ✒️ grapho — write, prescribe, document |
| 🐬 Partner | 🦉 logos — reason, analyze, interpret |

The expressive operators at 🟠 carry a circulatory quality: plico (folding/layering, which is what a circuit does to exercises), grapho (documenting the rotation). The 🟠 version of 🦢 plico is most literal — exercises are literally folded together into a rotating structure.

### Equipment Notes

Tier 0–3: bodyweight through barbell range, but barbells are excluded by the loop logic constraint. The effective range is Tier 0–2 plus benches, boxes, and any Tier 3 equipment that does not require loading time (a bench is Tier 3 but usable in a circuit; a barbell is Tier 3 and not usable in a circuit).

No GOLD. Olympic lifts require specific setup and coaching attention that circuit format prohibits. Plyometrics at the GOLD level (depth drops, weighted box jumps) require reset time between reps that breaks circuit flow.

### CSS Direction

🟠 carries terracotta warmth (#E07A3A range — not traffic orange, not neon). The UI at this Color should feel like a warm room full of movement: station indicators showing which tissue is working, a clear visual rotation map, the ARAM block displayed as a loop rather than a list. Color coding by station helps the user navigate the rotation at a glance. The visual language communicates: everyone moves together.

### When to Choose This Color

When the goal is cardiovascular efficiency paired with resistance work. When you want to move continuously without the long rest periods of strength training. When you are training with others and need a format that accommodates different loads at each station. 🟠 is also the right choice when you are tired of linear progressions and want the variety of a rotating format without the chaos of unstructured training.

## 🟡 Fun — Constrained exploration, structured play

**Equipment:** Tier 0–5 | **GOLD:** No | **Polarity:** Preparatory

### Tonal Register

🟡 Fun is the Play tonal name: light, curious, exploratory, optional. The person who writes in 🟡 register is floating ideas without attachment. "What if we tried X?" No pressure. The exploration might go somewhere, might not. The reader is not being directed — they are being invited.

In publication: 🟡 frames architectural exploration and seeds. "What if the 🚂 block evolved into a community recommendation surface?" Idea documents, seeds, and forward-looking notes live in 🟡. The register is specific and curious, not vague and enthusiastic.

### Session Character

A 🟡 Fun session is not chaos. The Order still applies. The Type still applies. The Axis still biases exercise selection. "Fun" is a Color constraint, not a release from constraints — it is constrained exploration within the boundaries the other three dials define.

What changes is the exercise selection logic: variety, unfamiliarity, and play are prioritized alongside (not instead of) the standard Axis bias. A 🟡 session might surface exercises the user has never done at this Type before. It might sequence movements in non-standard ways. It might use equipment that would not appear in 🔵 Structured or 🟣 Technical sessions.

The session has permission to surprise.

### Block Sequence Impact

Color modifier on the Order default:
- **+🏖 Sandbox permitted.** The Sandbox block (constrained exploration) is available at 🟡. This is the block where the user has bounded autonomy — three options, all valid for the code, they choose. The exploration is real; the constraints are also real.
- **+🌎 Exposure permitted.** The Exposure block (revealing weaknesses under controlled stress, expanding movement vocabulary) suits 🟡. New movements. Unfamiliar angles. Exercises that expand what the user knows is possible.
- **+🔠 Choice modifier available.** The Choice block modifier (bounded autonomy on other blocks) fits the 🟡 register — the session offers options rather than prescribing a single path.
- **Full tier range (0–5) for equipment.** 🟡 unlocks the widest equipment range of any Color. Not because it is the most advanced, but because exploration requires access to things you might not use otherwise. Specialty equipment becomes available here.
- **Block count at Order default.** 🟡 does not change block count; it changes what lives inside blocks.

### Operator Derivation

🟡 is a Preparatory Color. It triggers the first operator in each Axis pair.

| Axis | This Color's Operator |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 📍 pono — set, place, position |
| 🔨 Functional | 🧸 fero — carry, transfer, channel |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 👀 specio — inspect, observe, monitor |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🪵 teneo — hold, anchor, persist |
| ⌛ Time | 🐋 duco — orchestrate, lead, conduct |
| 🐬 Partner | 🧲 capio — receive, assess, intake |

The preparatory operators at 🟡 carry a lightness: pono as placing yourself in an unfamiliar position to see what you find, specio as looking at a movement you have not inspected before, fero as carrying an idea from one domain to another. The 🟡 version of 📍 pono is "try standing here and see what happens."

### Equipment Notes

Tier 0–5: the full range. This is the widest equipment scope in the system. Every tier is available — from bodyweight through specialty equipment. The 🟡 session can use a stone, a sled, a GHD, or none of those things. The tier range serves the exploratory mandate: discovery requires access to what you haven't tried.

No GOLD despite full tier access. Olympic lifts and advanced plyometrics are not appropriate in a playful context — they require precision and respect that the Fun register does not provide. The GOLD gate is about context, not capability. 🟡 is not the right container.

### CSS Direction

🟡 carries aged gold (#F2C744 range — not safety yellow, not neon). The UI at this Color should feel like a notebook with interesting ideas written in the margins: the block structure is present but the visual vocabulary has more variety. Exercise names in unusual groupings. Equipment icons mixing tiers. Sandbox blocks have a slightly different visual treatment — lighter, more exploratory. The visual language communicates: this is permission to be curious.

### When to Choose This Color

When you are bored with your current sequence. When you want to expand what you know how to do. When the training is going well and you have space to explore without consequence. 🟡 is also the right choice after a long block of 🔵 Structured sessions — the prescription has served its purpose, and now the prescription can breathe.

## ⚪ Mindful — Slow tempo, honest body, extended rest

**Equipment:** Tier 0–3 | **GOLD:** No | **Polarity:** Preparatory

### Tonal Register

⚪ Mindful is the Eudaimonia tonal name: honest, genuine, clear, vulnerable. The person who writes in ⚪ register is being real. No performance. No filler. The prose has space around it — breath between sentences. The reader can hear themselves think.

In publication: ⚪ frames honest admission. "I didn't invent seasons. I observed how humans already live." Almanac entries carry ⚪ energy at their heart. Vulnerable personal notes live in ⚪. The register is clear, not soft — honest does not mean tentative.

### Session Character

A ⚪ Mindful session is characterized by what it removes: speed, volume, urgency, noise. Four-second eccentrics. Two-minute rest periods minimum. Breathing cues integrated into every block. Maximum whitespace between movements.

This is the albedo session — the purification. It strips the training back to what the body is actually saying under slow, attentive load. A 4-second eccentric barbell squat at ⚪ reveals things that a fast squat buries. The session is not gentle in the sense of easy — it is precise in the sense of attentive.

🖼 Restoration + 🌹 Aesthetic + ⚪ Mindful = the deepest recovery lane in the system. These three together produce a session where the aesthetic lens turns inward (pelvic floor, psoas, diaphragm, deep hip structures), the restoration load is minimal, and the mindful tempo allows actual contact with what those structures are doing. This is not beginner work; it is work that requires sufficient body awareness to do at all.

The 🪫 Release block at ⚪ functions as parasympathetic downregulation. The direction is DOWN — tension decreasing, nervous system shifting toward recovery. This is the opposite of 🔴's Release (stress OUT, cathartic) and distinct from 🖼's Release (somatic return to baseline). ⚪ Release is the long exhale.

### Block Sequence Impact

Color modifier on the Order default:
- **Extended ♨️ Warm-Up.** The Mindful warm-up is longer than Order default. Joint circles, gentle loading, breath work before any significant load. The warm-up is not rushed.
- **Extended 🪫 Release.** The Mindful release is longer than Order default. The session ends with deliberate parasympathetic downregulation — not a few stretches but a full descent.
- **Slow tempo throughout.** Every block carries the 4-second eccentric instruction. This applies to all movements in the session — not just the designated slow exercises.
- **2+ minute rest between sets.** This is a Color-level override of Order's default rest. Even ⛽ Strength at ⚪ Color uses extended rest — the Mindful format demands that tempo and attentiveness take priority over density.
- **Block count at Order default.** ⚪ does not change block count; it changes the pace and quality inside each block.
- **No 🌋 Gutter.** The Gutter block is explicitly blocked in ⚪ contexts. Maximum effort and mindful attention are incompatible.

### Operator Derivation

⚪ is a Preparatory Color. It triggers the first operator in each Axis pair.

| Axis | This Color's Operator |
|------|-----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 📍 pono — set, place, position |
| 🔨 Functional | 🧸 fero — carry, transfer, channel |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 👀 specio — inspect, observe, monitor |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🪵 teneo — hold, anchor, persist |
| ⌛ Time | 🐋 duco — orchestrate, lead, conduct |
| 🐬 Partner | 🧲 capio — receive, assess, intake |

The preparatory operators at ⚪ carry their most contemplative meanings: pono as the slow, deliberate placement of stance and grip before a slow rep, specio as genuine observation of what is happening in the body, teneo as the sustained hold that is the entire point. The 🪵 teneo operator is almost native to the ⚪ register — holding, anchoring, persisting under slow tempo is exactly what mindful training does.

### Equipment Notes

Tier 0–3: bodyweight through barbell, rack, and bench. ⚪ does not need machines or cables (Tier 4) and does not use specialty equipment (Tier 5). The mindful register belongs in the standard training environment using standard equipment at slow tempo. A barbell Romanian deadlift with a 4-second eccentric in ⚪ is a completely different experience from the same exercise at normal tempo — no equipment change required.

No GOLD. Ballistic exercises and slow mindful tempo are categorically incompatible. A power clean performed at 4-second eccentric is not a power clean. GOLD exercises require velocity; ⚪ removes it.

### CSS Direction

⚪ carries warm off-white (#F5F0E8 range — not clinical white, not paper white). The UI at this Color should be the most spacious in the system: maximum whitespace between blocks, slower animations, breath cues displayed prominently. Rest timers count up rather than down — the session is not rushing. The block structure has generous padding. The visual language communicates: there is no hurry here. Pay attention.

### When to Choose This Color

When the nervous system is high and the training needs to be honest. When you have been moving fast for a long time and need to hear what the body is actually saying. When recovery is the goal but passive rest is not enough — the body needs to move, just slowly and attentively. ⚪ is not a rest day. It is a high-quality, slow-tempo session that respects what the body needs when it is running near empty.

## Color Interaction Map

The 8 Colors do not operate in isolation. Their interactions with Orders produce distinct session characters beyond what either dial alone specifies.

**Order × Color quadrant behavior:**

High-Order + Expressive Colors (⛽🔴, ⛽🟣, 🏟🔴, 🏟🟣): Maximum output sessions. The highest CNS demand in the system. These are reserved for athletes with the training age and recovery to absorb them.

High-Order + Preparatory Colors (⛽⚫, ⛽🟢, 🏟⚫, 🏟🟢): The check-valve sessions. High Order demands with preparatory format constraints. ⛽🟢 is the bodyweight strength check valve. 🏟⚫ is the coached benchmark — testing with extended instruction.

Low-Order + Expressive Colors (🐂🔵, 🐂🟠, 🖼🔵, 🖼🟠): Low load at high structure or circulation. 🖼🟠 is a restoration circuit — gentle enough to qualify as recovery, structured enough to produce tissue rotation. 🐂🔵 is prescribed learning — pattern acquisition with a trackable prescription.

Low-Order + Preparatory Colors (🖼⚪, 🖼🟢, 🐂⚫, 🐂🟢): The deepest recovery and foundational learning sessions. 🖼⚪ is the Restoration Lane entry point. 🐂⚫ is the teaching baseline — learning patterns with maximal comprehension and minimal load.

**The natural breath of a training week:**

A week of varied Colors follows the inhale/exhale rhythm: gathering sessions build capacity for expressing it; expressive sessions require gathering sessions to sustain them. A week of only 🔴 is not a training week — it is a self-destructive pattern. A week of only ⚪ is not training — it is avoidance. The breath requires both.

## Open Questions

- Color × Order interaction weights are not yet fully specified. When 🟣 Technical (fewer blocks, extended rest) meets 🏟 Performance (3–4 blocks max), the interaction is clear. But 🟣 Technical × 🦋 Hypertrophy (6–7 blocks default) requires judgment about how far 🟣 compresses the block count. A decision rule is needed.
- The tonal name / operational name dual identity needs explicit UI treatment guidance. The app should surface both names in specific contexts — which surfaces show only the operational name, which show both?
- Color-as-temperament in the editorial layer (from publication-standard.md) is specified for the Cosmogram context. It needs a separate specification for how it modulates the tonal register of workout cards — how different does a 🔴 card read from a ⚪ card at the same zip code position?
- The alchemical correspondence (nigredo → albedo → citrinitas → rubedo) is documented here as descriptive context. Whether this layer ever becomes user-facing content is an open design question.
- Dark mode: if the app develops a dark mode, the ⚪ Mindful Color has special considerations. Warm off-white on dark background requires recalibration — the "spacious" quality needs to be preserved without the white-space visual anchor.
