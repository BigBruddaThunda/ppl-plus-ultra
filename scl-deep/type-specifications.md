# Type Specifications — Deep Reference

## Preamble

### The 5-Type System

PPL± is built on the classical Push/Pull/Legs split — the most durable organizing principle in resistance training. Three Types, three sessions, every muscle group covered. But the classical split has a ceiling. It trains muscle groups. It does not train integration, power production, or energy systems as first-class citizens.

➕ Plus and ➖ Ultra are the extension beyond that ceiling.

**Plus Ultra etymology:** ➕ and ➖ together form "Plus Ultra" — the motto of Charles V of Spain. The original inscription on the Pillars of Hercules read *Nec Plus Ultra*: "no further beyond." It was a warning. The known world ended there. Charles dropped the "Nec" — the negation — and his fleet sailed into the Atlantic. *Plus Ultra*: further beyond. An invitation to exceed limits.

The 5th and 6th positions in the Type dial extend the classical 3-day split exactly the way the motto extends the Pillars. Push, Pull, Legs are the known world. Plus and Ultra are what lies beyond.

### Type as Direction

Each Type is a direction of movement, of force, of attention:

- **🛒 Push** — output. Force leaving the body. Expression. You give something away.
- **🪡 Pull** — input. Force returning to the body. Reception. You take something in.
- **🍗 Legs** — foundation. Force through the ground. Infrastructure. The base everything stands on.
- **➕ Plus** — addition. Integration across the body. Combination. More than the sum of parts.
- **➖ Ultra** — subtraction. Refinement through reduction. Efficiency. Finding the minimum path.

The direction metaphor is not decorative. It describes the actual mechanical intent of each Type. Push exercises move load away from the centerline. Pull exercises move load toward it. Legs exercises manage ground reaction force. Plus exercises combine vectors. Ultra exercises sustain a single vector over time.

## Gear 2: Type in the Rotation Engine

The Default Rotation Engine runs three interlocking cycles. Type is Gear 2 — a rolling 5-day perpetual calendar.

**Rolling 5-day cycle (Jan 1 = Push):**

| Day Position | Type |
|-------------|------|
| 0 (mod 5) | 🛒 Push |
| 1 (mod 5) | 🪡 Pull |
| 2 (mod 5) | 🍗 Legs |
| 3 (mod 5) | ➕ Plus |
| 4 (mod 5) | ➖ Ultra |

Jan 1 = Push. Jan 2 = Pull. Jan 3 = Legs. Jan 4 = Plus. Jan 5 = Ultra. Jan 6 = Push again. The cycle does not reset for the week. It does not align to Monday. It rolls forward from January 1st without interruption.

**Coprime relationship with the 7-day Order cycle:**

5 and 7 share no common factor. They are coprime. Because of this:
- The Type-Order pairing on any given weekday shifts every week.
- Monday is always 🐂 Foundation (Gear 1 is fixed by weekday). But Monday's Type changes every week.
- The same Order-Type pairing on the same weekday does not repeat for 35 days (5 × 7 = 35-day super-cycle).

**Annual arithmetic:**
- 365 ÷ 5 = 73 full Type rotations per year
- 365 ÷ 35 = ~10.4 super-cycles per year (Order-Type pairings per weekday)
- 35 does not divide evenly into 365, so Year 2 starts on a different Type than Year 1. Multi-year drift is built in.

**Practical meaning:** The user who trains Monday/Wednesday/Friday sees a different Type combination each week. The training stays varied without requiring programming decisions. The coprime relationship does the work automatically.

**Open question (from default-rotation-engine.md):** Does the Type cycle start Jan 1 for all users (global sync = shared community rhythm) or on account creation date (personal offset = no staleness, no shared rhythm)? This decision affects whether community boards can be typed by day. Unresolved.

## 🛒 Push — Output

### Muscle Groups and Movement Domains

**Primary muscles:** Pectoralis major (sternal and clavicular heads), pectoralis minor, anterior deltoid, lateral deltoid, triceps brachii (all three heads), serratus anterior.

**Secondary muscles (recruited, not targeted):** Anterior core (pressing stability), forearm extensors, coracobrachialis.

**Primary movement patterns:**
- Horizontal pressing: bench press (flat, incline, decline), push-up variations, dumbbell press
- Vertical pressing: overhead press, push press, handstand push-up
- Adduction/fly: cable crossover, pec deck, dumbbell fly
- Triceps isolation: extension, pushdown, kickback, dip

**Movement domain:** Force moves away from the body. The shoulder girdle protracts. The elbow extends. The torso may be supine (horizontal press) or upright (vertical press). In both cases, load travels outward from centerline.

### Primary Exercise Patterns

1. Horizontal pressing — the bench press family and its variations
2. Incline pressing — upper chest emphasis, anterior delt contribution increases
3. Vertical pressing — overhead press, shoulder dominance increases
4. Push-up and dip variations — bodyweight and loaded bodyweight patterns
5. Fly and adduction — cable and dumbbell, chest stretch at end range
6. Triceps isolation — extensions and pushdowns when triceps are the target, not the contributor
7. Explosive pressing — medicine ball chest throws, push press with intent (bridging to ➕ Plus)

### Exercise Library Routing

| Section | Content | Push Relevance |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Section C: Chest (140)** | Pectoralis major/minor, serratus anterior. Flat/incline/decline pressing, push-ups, flyes, cables, specialty bars. | Primary. Core Push section. |
| **Section B: Shoulders (180)** | Anterior and lateral deltoid pressing. Overhead press variants, pike push-up, handstand push-up, landmine press. | Primary for overhead pressing. Posterior delt (#101–120) routes to 🪡 Pull. |
| **Section E: Arms — Triceps (#51–95, 200 total)** | Triceps brachii. Extensions, pushdowns, kickbacks, dips, close-grip bench. | Primary for triceps isolation. Biceps (#1–50) route to Pull. |

**GOLD-gated Push exercises:**
- Section B: #9 Push Jerk, #14 Log Press, #137–140 Barbell/Hang/Power/Muscle Snatch (if used as a push loading pattern), #141–144 Sandbag/Keg/Atlas shoulder work — require 🔴 or 🟣
- Section C: #121–125 Bamboo bar, earthquake bar, board press, sling shot — require 🔴 or 🟣

**Section boundaries:** The explosive overlap with ➕ Plus happens at the boundary of ballistic pressing (medicine ball throws, push press for power). When the goal is power production and full-body integration, the exercise routes to Plus. When the goal is chest/shoulder/triceps development with pressing mechanics, it stays in Push.

### Axis Interaction Matrix

| Axis | Selection Bias for Push |
|------|-------------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Barbell bench press, barbell overhead press, weighted dips. Bilateral, barbell-first, classic compound angles. |
| 🔨 Functional | Landmine press, single-arm dumbbell press, push-up variations requiring ground contact and instability. Standing OHP over seated. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Cable fly, pec deck, cable crossover, incline dumbbell fly. Isolation with full ROM. The stretch at the bottom of a cable fly. |
| 🪐 Challenge | Deficit push-up, paused bench, ring push-up, board press, archer push-up, handstand push-up progressions, bamboo bar press. The hardest variation of any pressing pattern. |
| ⌛ Time | EMOM push-up sets, timed overhead press density blocks, TUT bench (4s eccentric). Protocol comes from Order × Color interaction. |
| 🐬 Partner | Spottable bench variations, partner-assisted push-ups, synchronized overhead press, alternating log press. |

### Color Equipment Interaction

- **⚫ Teaching (Tier 2–3):** Barbell bench, dumbbell OHP. Extended rest, coaching cues on scapular retraction and bar path. No GOLD.
- **🟢 Bodyweight (Tier 0–2):** Push-ups (all variations), pike push-up, dips on chairs/parallettes, band-resisted push-up. No barbells. Advanced calisthenics apply at ⛽ Order: archer push-ups, ring push-ups, planche progressions, handstand push-up progressions.
- **🔵 Structured (Tier 2–3):** Prescribed sets/reps/rest. Dumbbell or barbell pressing with a progressive loading scheme. Trackable across sessions.
- **🟣 Technical (Tier 2–5):** GOLD unlocked. Push jerk, bamboo bar bench, earthquake bar OHP. Precision over volume. Rest periods extended. Session ends when form breaks.
- **🔴 Intense (Tier 2–4):** GOLD unlocked. Supersets (chest + triceps, push + fly). Higher volume, reduced rest. Log press, atlas stone pressing within a loaded complex.
- **🟠 Circuit (Tier 0–3):** Push-up stations, band press, dumbbell press. No barbells. Loop logic: Push station must be followed by non-Push tissue station.
- **🟡 Fun (Tier 0–5):** Variety within Push. Unorthodox pressing angles, medicine ball throws against walls, partner resistance push-ups. Order/Type constraints still apply.
- **⚪ Mindful (Tier 0–3):** 4s eccentric press, dumbbell floor press with breath cues, band pull-apart between sets. Extended rest (2+ min). Somatic attention to chest stretch and shoulder position.

### Order Fit

- **⛽ Strength:** Push is one of the two strongest natural fits for ⛽ (alongside Pull). Barbell bench and OHP are the canonical heavy pressing moves. CNS demand aligns.
- **🦋 Hypertrophy:** Push thrives in 🦋. Volume accumulation for pec/delt/triceps development. The pump is real and trackable.
- **🏟 Performance:** Bench press 1RM, strict press 1RM, push jerk max. Test and record. No junk pressing volume after.
- **🐂 Foundation:** Pattern learning. Scapular mechanics, bar path discipline, tricep lockout. Load is sub-maximal; technique is the target.
- **🌾 Full Body:** Push contributes when integrated into compound flows — the press component of a clean-and-press, the push phase of a thruster. Isolated push patterns break the unity test.
- **⚖ Balance:** ⚖🛒 targets the gap muscles: triceps (long head), lateral delts, front delts. Not the primary movers — the secondary players that fall behind.
- **🖼 Restoration:** ⚖🛒 in restoration mode = shoulder mobility and thoracic extension. Prone Y/T/W, band pull-aparts (as shoulder health work, not push work), chest opener stretches, pec minor release.

### The Push Direction

Push is the direction of giving something away. Force leaves the hands. The chest opens. The arms extend toward the world. In the gym this is pressing — but in the body's logic, push movements express capacity outward. You offer weight to space. The concentric of a bench press is an act of emission. This is why the operator for expressive Push (🏛 × expressive color) is 🤌 facio — to execute, to perform, to produce. Push produces.

## 🪡 Pull — Input

### Muscle Groups and Movement Domains

**Primary muscles:** Latissimus dorsi, teres major, rhomboids, middle and lower trapezius, posterior deltoid, biceps brachii (long and short heads), brachialis, brachioradialis, erector spinae (as stabilizer and in hip hinge patterns).

**Secondary muscles (recruited, not targeted):** Forearm flexors, grip structures (flexor digitorum superficialis/profundus), rear delt (shared with shoulder posterior work), upper traps (as shrug contributor).

**Primary movement patterns:**
- Vertical pulling: pull-up, chin-up, lat pulldown, straight-arm pulldown
- Horizontal rowing: barbell row, cable row, dumbbell row, T-bar row
- Hip hinge: deadlift, Romanian deadlift, good morning, trap bar deadlift
- Biceps isolation: curl variations (standing, preacher, concentration, cable)
- Rear delt and rotator cuff isolation: face pull, band pull-apart, reverse fly

**Movement domain:** Force returns toward the body. The elbows drive back and down. The lats compress. The scapulae retract. The hinge pattern (deadlift) is a hip-dominant extension — the posterior chain fires, the bar returns to the hip crease. Both vertical pulling and the hinge are reception: the load comes toward you.

### Primary Exercise Patterns

1. Vertical pulling — pull-up and lat pulldown family
2. Horizontal rowing — barbell, dumbbell, cable, and machine rows
3. Hip hinge — deadlift and RDL family; hinge patterns where the posterior chain is the primary driver
4. Biceps isolation — curls when the biceps, not the back, are the intended target
5. Rear delt and rotator cuff — face pulls, reverse fly, external rotation when pulling mechanics are the base
6. Scapular control — shrugs, scap pull-ups, prone Y/T/W as structural work
7. Trap development — upper trap (shrug patterns), mid trap (rows), lower trap (depression patterns)

### Exercise Library Routing

| Section | Content | Pull Relevance |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Section D: Back (325)** | Lats, traps, rhomboids, erectors. Vertical pulling (#1–30), horizontal rowing (#44–80), deadlift variants (#221–260), loaded carries (#261–270). | Primary. Core Pull section. |
| **Section B: Shoulders — Posterior (#101–120, 180 total)** | Posterior deltoid, rotator cuff (external rotation), face pull, rear delt fly. | Primary for posterior delt and rotator cuff pulling patterns. |
| **Section E: Arms — Biceps (#1–50, 200 total)** | Biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis. All curl variations. | Primary for biceps isolation. |
| **Section G: Hips & Glutes — Hinge patterns (#16–30, 180 total)** | Deadlift, RDL, good morning, hip hinge patterns where glute/hamstring drives movement. | Primary for hip hinge (hinge = Pull-type movement domain). |

**GOLD-gated Pull exercises:**
- Section D: #264 Yoke Walk, #265 Zercher Carry, #270 Keg Carry, #319 Atlas Stone Lift, #320 Tire Flip — require 🔴 or 🟣
- The deadlift and its barbell derivatives are NOT GOLD-gated. They are standard ⛽ and 🏟 territory.

**The hinge overlap:** The Romanian deadlift and conventional deadlift occupy Pull (posterior chain, hip extension, bar travels toward body in the eccentric). This is why Section G hinge patterns route to 🪡. The distinction from 🍗 Legs: when the hip joint is the primary hinge and the spine is the stable axis, it's Pull. When the knee and quad are the primary drivers (squat, lunge), it's Legs.

### Axis Interaction Matrix

| Axis | Selection Bias for Pull |
|------|------------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Barbell row (bent-over, Pendlay), deadlift, weighted pull-up, barbell shrug. Bilateral, barbell-first. The pull movements that have defined training for 80 years. |
| 🔨 Functional | Single-arm dumbbell row, single-leg RDL, renegade row, unilateral cable row. Unilateral pulling where trunk stability is tested alongside the pulling pattern. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Straight-arm pulldown, single-arm cable pulldown, concentration curl, cable rear delt fly. Isolation of the lat sweep, bicep peak, rear delt tie-in. MMC over load. |
| 🪐 Challenge | Weighted pull-up (heavy), deficit deadlift, paused pull-up at top, archer row, L-sit chin-up, Romanian deadlift with 3s pause at bottom. The hardest version of any pulling pattern. |
| ⌛ Time | EMOM pull-ups or deadlifts, timed rowing machine intervals, 3-minute sustained row, density blocks of curls. |
| 🐬 Partner | Spottable deadlifts and rows, partner-assisted pull-ups, alternating cable rows, relay rowing machine intervals. |

### Color Equipment Interaction

- **⚫ Teaching (Tier 2–3):** Deadlift mechanics, row setup, lat pulldown scapular control. Extended rest. Coaching density over loading density.
- **🟢 Bodyweight (Tier 0–2):** Pull-ups, chin-ups, bodyweight rows (TRX/rings/bar), band-assisted chin-up, inverted row under a table or bar. No barbell deadlifts. Advanced calisthenics at ⛽: muscle-up, one-arm pull-up progressions, L-sit chin-up.
- **🔵 Structured (Tier 2–3):** Prescribed pull and row combinations with defined loading progression. Trackable deadlift sets, programmed pull-up volume.
- **🟣 Technical (Tier 2–5):** GOLD unlocked. Atlas stone lift, yoke walk (if in program). Precision on pulling mechanics. Extended rest.
- **🔴 Intense (Tier 2–4):** GOLD unlocked. Supersets (back + biceps, pull-up + row). High volume. Reduced rest. Rowing machine intervals within a pull complex.
- **🟠 Circuit (Tier 0–3):** Pull-up stations, band row, TRX row, dumbbell row. No barbells. Loop logic: Pull station followed by non-Pull tissue station.
- **🟡 Fun (Tier 0–5):** Varied grip pull-ups, unusual rowing angles, TRX-based pulling play, rope climbs if available. Order/Type constraints still apply.
- **⚪ Mindful (Tier 0–3):** 4s eccentric pull-up or row, banded lat stretch, dead hang with breath cues. Attention to lat lengthening in the stretched position.

### Order Fit

- **⛽ Strength:** Pull is one of the two strongest natural fits for ⛽. Deadlift and heavy row are the canonical back-building heavy movements. Low reps, full rest, neural force production.
- **🦋 Hypertrophy:** Pull thrives in 🦋. Lat, trap, and bicep volume accumulation. Pump in the lats after 4 sets of straight-arm pulldown is real and specific.
- **🏟 Performance:** Deadlift 1RM, pull-up max reps, 2km row time trial. Test, record, leave.
- **🐂 Foundation:** Hinge pattern learning — the deadlift setup, the scapular positioning in a row, hip hinge mechanics before load is added.
- **🌾 Full Body:** Pull contributes in clean patterns, renegade rows built into a flow, Romanian deadlift as the hinge phase of a complex. Isolated row sets break the unity test.
- **⚖ Balance:** ⚖🪡 targets the gap muscles: biceps, rear delts, forearms, grip. The muscles that fall behind when pressing dominates a program.
- **🖼 Restoration:** ⚖🪡 in restoration mode = posterior chain tension release. Hip flexor/psoas stretch, lat elongation, foam roll thoracic spine, dead hang decompression.

### The Pull Direction

Pull is the direction of taking something in. Force moves toward the body. The lats fire, the elbows pull back, the scapulae retract. The deadlift is reception — you receive the bar from the floor and return it. The curl is intake. The row is gathering. In the body's logic, pull movements absorb, receive, collect. This maps to the operator for expressive Pull contexts: 🤌 facio (under 🏛 Basics), but more fundamentally the receiving operator 🧲 capio — to receive, to intake, to take in what is offered. Pull absorbs capacity.

## 🍗 Legs — Foundation

### Muscle Groups and Movement Domains

**Primary muscles:** Quadriceps (rectus femoris, vastus lateralis/medialis/intermedius), hamstrings (biceps femoris long and short heads, semitendinosus, semimembranosus), gluteus maximus (as prime mover in squat patterns — also covered in Section G, but as quad/leg driver in Legs context), gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior.

**Secondary muscles (recruited, not targeted):** Hip adductors (in squat depth), hip flexors (eccentric in squat descent), peroneals, popliteus, intrinsic foot musculature (as stabilizers).

**Primary movement patterns:**
- Squat: bilateral squat patterns (back squat, front squat, goblet squat, leg press)
- Lunge: split squat, reverse lunge, walking lunge, Bulgarian split squat
- Single-leg: pistol squat, single-leg press, step-up
- Leg press and machine isolation: leg press, hack squat, leg extension, leg curl
- Calf work: standing and seated calf raise, tibialis work
- Hamstring isolation: leg curl, Nordic curl, good morning (when quad-assist is involved)

**Movement domain:** Force through the ground. Bilateral or unilateral, the legs manage ground reaction force. The squat is a descent and return — the floor pushes back. The lunge is a split balance point. The calf raise is plantar flexion against gravity. Legs work is architecture: it is the floor plan beneath everything else.

### Primary Exercise Patterns

1. Bilateral squat — back squat, front squat, goblet squat, hack squat, leg press
2. Unilateral squat — Bulgarian split squat, single-leg press, pistol squat, step-up
3. Lunge patterns — reverse, walking, lateral, curtsy, deficit lunge
4. Leg isolation — leg extension (quad), leg curl (hamstring), sissy squat
5. Calf and lower leg — standing calf raise, seated calf raise, tibialis raise, toe work
6. Hamstring compound — Nordic curl, GHR, lying leg curl (when hamstring is target over hip hinge mechanics)

**Hinge boundary:** Hamstring compound movements that hinge at the hip (RDL, deadlift, good morning) route to 🪡 Pull when the posterior chain and hip extension are the intent. They route to 🍗 Legs when the knee flexion and hamstring contraction are the primary target (lying leg curl, Nordic curl). The movement domain determines the Type, not the muscle alone.

### Exercise Library Routing

| Section | Content | Legs Relevance |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Section H: Thighs (200)** | Quadriceps (#1–110), hamstrings (#111–170). Squat patterns, lunge patterns, leg press, leg extension, leg curl, Nordic curl, GHR. | Primary. Core Legs section. |
| **Section G: Hips & Glutes — Squat/lunge patterns (#31–40, 180 total)** | Glute-dominant squat and lunge patterns. Glute bridge, hip thrust (when quad/glute loading is the target). | Primary for glute-dominant Legs patterns. Hinge patterns (#16–30) route to Pull. |
| **Section I: Lower Leg & Foot (80)** | Gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis anterior, peroneals, foot intrinsics. Calf raise variations, tibialis work, ankle stability. | Primary. Complete Legs section. |

**Note on Section G split:** Hinge patterns (#16–30 in Section G) = Pull type. Squat/lunge patterns (#31–40) = Legs type. Glute isolation (#41–50) = Legs or Balance depending on context. Glute med/min stabilization (#51–80) = Balance or Functional.

### Axis Interaction Matrix

| Axis | Selection Bias for Legs |
|------|------------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Back squat (high and low bar), front squat, conventional leg press, standing calf raise. Barbell-first, bilateral, proven compound patterns. |
| 🔨 Functional | Bulgarian split squat, single-leg press, step-up with dumbbells, single-leg calf raise, lateral lunge. Unilateral. Ground-based. Athletic transfer. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Leg extension, sissy squat, leg curl, calf raise with slow eccentric, split squat with forward lean for quad sweep. Isolation and shaping. The angle matters. |
| 🪐 Challenge | Pistol squat, pause squat (full depth), deficit lunge, Nordic curl, band-resisted squat, barbell hip belt squat. The hardest variation that can be controlled. |
| ⌛ Time | EMOM goblet squat complex, timed Bulgarian split squat holds, 90-second calf raise super-accumulation set, lunge-for-time intervals. |
| 🐬 Partner | Spottable back squat, alternating lunge with partner, synchronized leg press, partner-resisted leg extension. |

### Color Equipment Interaction

- **⚫ Teaching (Tier 2–3):** Squat mechanics, knee tracking, depth progression, bar placement teaching. Goblet squat as the learning vehicle for back squat. Extended rest and cues.
- **🟢 Bodyweight (Tier 0–2):** Bodyweight squat, lunge, jump squat, pistol squat progressions, wall sit, glute bridge, donkey calf raise with partner. No barbell. At ⛽ Order: pistol squats, shrimp squats, single-leg variations under load (vest/DB).
- **🔵 Structured (Tier 2–3):** Programmed squat progression with defined percentages, prescribed lunge volume, tracked calf raise loading.
- **🟣 Technical (Tier 2–5):** Precision on squat mechanics, pause squats, tempo work. GOLD unlocked — if relevant Legs + GOLD exercises exist (specialty machines tier 4–5).
- **🔴 Intense (Tier 2–4):** High volume leg work. Drop sets on leg press, superset squat + lunge, high-rep leg extension finishers.
- **🟠 Circuit (Tier 0–3):** Squat station, lunge station, calf raise station. Loop logic: Legs station followed by non-Legs tissue station. No barbells.
- **🟡 Fun (Tier 0–5):** Squat variations for variety, indoor sled pushes, stair climbing, varied lunge angles, game-based lower body drills.
- **⚪ Mindful (Tier 0–3):** Slow goblet squat (4s down, pause at bottom, 4s up), extended rest, attention to knee tracking and ankle mobility. Calf stretch integrated between sets.

### Order Fit

- **⛽ Strength:** Squat and leg press are natural heavy Strength movements. Back squat at 80% for 5 sets of 5 is canonical ⛽🍗 territory.
- **🦋 Hypertrophy:** Legs thrives in 🦋. Quad and hamstring hypertrophy via volume — leg press, Bulgarian split squat, leg extension, leg curl sequenced for maximum metabolic stress.
- **🏟 Performance:** Squat 1RM, vertical jump test, 40-yard dash, single-leg strength assessment. Test, record, leave.
- **🐂 Foundation:** Squat pattern learning. Goblet squat, box squat, air squat — grooving the movement before loading it.
- **🌾 Full Body:** Legs contributes as the squat phase of a thruster or clean-to-squat. The legs are always involved in full-body integration, but 🌾🍗 means the integration is leg-dominant.
- **⚖ Balance:** ⚖🍗 zooms to the gap muscles: calves, adductors, tibialis anterior. The ankle stability work, the tibialis raise, the adductor machine, the split squat for the weak leg.
- **🖼 Restoration:** ⚖🍗 in restoration mode = hip mobility, ankle mobility, pelvic floor. Hip 90/90 stretch, pigeon pose, ankle CARs, tibialis release. The legs as a mobility system, not a loading system.

### The Legs Direction

Legs is foundation in the most literal sense — it is contact with the earth. Every squat begins with the floor's resistance. Every push off the ground is a response to that surface. Legs training is infrastructure: you are building the base that the upper body sits on, that carries the load, that produces velocity in sport. A strong press with weak legs is a column without a foundation. The direction is down and through — force into the earth and the earth's force returned. Legs is the dial that asks: how strong is your ground?

## ➕ Plus — Integration

### Muscle Groups and Movement Domains

**Primary target systems:** No single muscle group. The entire kinetic chain as one unit. Specifically:
- Power production: posterior chain (glutes, hamstrings), hip extensors, thoracic extensors, shoulder girdle in coordinated sequence
- Core stability as load transfer: transverse abdominis, obliques, QL, thoracolumbar fascia — not as isolated targets but as the structural bridge between lower and upper body
- Rotational and anti-rotation: obliques, QL, glute medius as lateral stabilizers

**Movement domains:**
- Olympic lifts and derivatives: clean, snatch, jerk, and all progressions
- Loaded carries: farmer's walk, yoke, sandbag, trap bar
- Full-body plyometrics: box jumps, bounds, depth jumps, med ball throws
- Rotational core: chop, lift, Pallof press, med ball rotational throw
- Anti-rotation: Pallof press, Copenhagen plank, suitcase carry
- Turkish get-up and get-up patterns: full kinetic chain integration
- Kettlebell flows and complexes: swing, clean, press, snatch sequences

**What makes an exercise ➕ Plus:** The test is whether isolating the exercise to a single muscle group destroys its purpose. A power clean is not a "back exercise." A Turkish get-up is not a "shoulder exercise." A Pallof press is not an "abs exercise." These exercises exist because the whole is the point. If you can assign an exercise to a single body part without loss of meaning, it probably belongs in one of the other four Types.

### Primary Exercise Patterns

1. Olympic lift patterns — clean, snatch, jerk, power versions, hang versions (GOLD-gated)
2. Loaded carries — farmer's walk, yoke, suitcase, sandbag, rack position carry
3. Explosive/plyometric — box jump, bound, depth jump, med ball slam, broad jump (GOLD-gated for high-impact)
4. Rotational power — med ball rotational throw, cable chop, cable lift, rotational slam
5. Anti-rotation core — Pallof press, Copenhagen plank, stir-the-pot, suitcase carry
6. Kettlebell complexes — KB swing (as full-body hip extension), KB snatch, KB clean, Turkish get-up
7. Full-body integration — bear crawl, renegade row (when integrated, not isolated), man-maker, burpee with load

- Section K: High-impact variations (#32–37, #63–65) — require 🔴 or 🟣; lower-impact technically default GOLD-gated
- Section Q: ALL 55 exercises — require 🔴 or 🟣
- Section L: Competition snatch/clean intent — require 🔴 or 🟣 even at tier 2–3 equipment

### Axis Interaction Matrix

| Axis | Selection Bias for Plus |
|------|------------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Power clean, hang clean, barbell complex (deadlift + clean + press), farmer's carry. The full barbell Olympic lifts when GOLD-gated. Classic loaded carries. |
| 🔨 Functional | Single-arm KB swing, single-arm farmer's carry, bear crawl, rotational med ball throw, unilateral loaded carry. Athletic transfer. Unilateral power. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | KB Turkish get-up (focusing on the transition quality), rotational core movements with controlled tempo, medicine ball core rotation. The quality of power, not just the output. |

| ⌛ Time | EMOM power clean singles, Tabata KB swing, AMRAP farmer's carry distance, 10-minute loaded carry relay. The time protocols that expose conditioning endurance in explosive work. |
| 🐬 Partner | Partner med ball throw, synchronized KB swing, alternating farmer's carry relay, tandem loaded carry, partner-resisted rotational throw. |

### Color Equipment Interaction

- **⚫ Teaching (Tier 2–3):** KB swing mechanics, power clean setup, Pallof press positioning. No GOLD. Extended rest and cueing density.
- **🟢 Bodyweight (Tier 0–2):** Burpee, bear crawl, broad jump, bounding, bodyweight rotational work, med ball if available (tier 2). No GOLD-gated plyometrics. Advanced bodyweight ➕: muscle-up (pull + push integration), one-arm handstand work.
- **🔵 Structured (Tier 2–3):** Programmed KB complex, prescribed carry distances, structured Pallof press sets. Trackable and repeatable.
- **🟣 Technical (Tier 2–5):** GOLD unlocked. Technique-focused Olympic lift singles (full clean, power snatch), extended rest, quality gate before each rep. Session ends when bar speed degrades.
- **🔴 Intense (Tier 2–4):** GOLD unlocked. Olympic lift complexes, atlas stone event training, tire flip intervals, loaded carry relays. High effort, compressed rest.
- **🟠 Circuit (Tier 0–3):** KB swing station, rotational throw station, Pallof press station. No barbells. No GOLD. Loop logic enforced — each Plus station changes tissue/demand.
- **🟡 Fun (Tier 0–5):** Med ball play, varied carry objects, partner relay carries, odd-implement experimentation.
- **⚪ Mindful (Tier 0–3):** Slow KB windmill, TGU with extended pause at each transition, Pallof press with 5s holds and breath focus. Integration through attention, not speed.

### Order Fit

- **⛽ Strength:** Plus contributes in the strength context through heavy carries and heavy pulls (deadlift as posterior chain) at the strength end of hip extension. Olympic lift primer sets fit ⛽🏛➕ territory.
- **🦋 Hypertrophy:** Plus is less natural in 🦋 — hypertrophy targets individual muscles, and Plus resists isolation. Where it fits: KB swing volume for posterior chain, carry-based hypertrophy through loaded time under tension.
- **🏟 Performance:** Plus is most at home in 🏟. Olympic lift max, vertical jump max, carry distance max. Full-body power expression is exactly what Performance tests.
- **🐂 Foundation:** Olympic lift technique development, KB swing pattern learning, Pallof press for anti-rotation awareness. Sub-maximal load, full focus on the integration pattern.
- **🌾 Full Body:** Plus and Full Body are highly compatible. The 🌾 flow test is naturally satisfied by compound patterns like the clean-and-press, thruster, and TGU — movements that flow without a reset.
- **⚖ Balance:** ⚖➕ = rotational stability, anti-rotation work. The suitcase carry for asymmetry, the single-arm Pallof press, the Copenhagen plank. Testing where the integrated system fails.
- **🖼 Restoration:** ⚖➕ in restoration mode = core as breath system. Diaphragm, TVA, pelvic floor coordination. Dead bug with breath cues, 90/90 breathing, Crocodile breathing. The integration becomes respiratory.

### The Plus Direction

Plus is addition. It is what happens when the individual parts stop operating as separate units and become one thing. A power clean is not a deadlift added to a front squat added to a pull. It is a single explosive event. The addition metaphor runs deep: Plus exercises add dimensions that isolated training cannot access — power production, ground reaction force transfer, rotational capacity, loaded locomotion. Plus is the dial that asks: do these parts work together? The answer is demonstrated, not declared. Either the bar rises with one coordinated intent or it doesn't.

## ➖ Ultra — Refinement

### Muscle Groups and Movement Domains

**Primary target system:** The cardiovascular and respiratory system — not as an incidental effect of training, but as the primary training object. Heart, lungs, vascular network, mitochondrial density, aerobic enzymes, lactate threshold, stroke volume, VO2 max.

**Involved musculature (varies by modality):**
- Running: calves, tibialis, hip flexors, glutes, core
- Rowing: full posterior chain, lats, biceps, legs (70% of rowing power is leg-driven)
- Cycling: quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves
- Swimming: full upper body pulling, kick-driven leg work
- Sled work: full-body, high metabolic demand, varied by push/pull
- Conditioning circuits: depends entirely on chosen exercises

**Primary movement patterns:**
- Continuous cardiorespiratory: running, cycling, rowing, swimming, skiing, assault bike
- Interval-based: sprint intervals, row intervals, circuit conditioning, Tabata
- Sled work: push and pull, both count as conditioning when metabolic demand is the goal
- Mobility flows: connected sequences of mobility exercises (🖼 context) where the cardiovascular benefit is secondary to nervous system restoration
- Sport drills: agility, footwork, cutting, sports-specific conditioning

**What makes an exercise ➖ Ultra:** The training goal is an energy system, not a muscle. You are developing your capacity to do work over time, not developing a specific tissue. A rowing machine set for maximum 2km is Pure Ultra. A rowing machine set for trap hypertrophy (6 × 10, slow and controlled) routes to Pull. The equipment is the same. The intent is the Type.

### Primary Exercise Patterns

1. Aerobic base — Zone 2 running, cycling, rowing at conversational pace (60–75% HRmax)
2. Sprint and interval — 400m repeats, rowing sprint intervals, assault bike Tabata
3. Sled work — push and pull as conditioning tools, not strength tools
4. Conditioning circuits — timed station work where the goal is metabolic accumulation
5. Jump rope — continuous or interval, full-body rhythmic cardio
6. Footwork and agility — ladder drills, cone drills, cutting drills (when conditioning is the target)
7. Mobility flows — connected movement sequences in 🖼 Restoration context

### Exercise Library Routing

| Section | Content | Ultra Relevance |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Section M: Cardio & Conditioning (75)** | Running (#1–18), rowing (#19–28), cycling (#29–36), swimming (#37–45), jump rope (#46–50), sled (#51–58), assault bike (#59–65), ski erg (#66–71), stair/elliptical (#72–74), battle ropes (#75). | Primary. Core Ultra section. |
| **Section O: Footwork & Agility (35)** | Ladder drills (#1–12), cone drills (#13–20), cutting/direction change (#21–29), reactive drills (#30–35). | Primary when conditioning is the goal. Agility for speed training routes here. |
| **Section N: Sport Focused (45)** | Agility/cutting (#21–31), court/field sport conditioning (#32–45). | Primary when sport conditioning is the intent. |
| **Section K: Plyometrics — Conditioning use** | Box jumps, bounding, reactive drills — when the intent is metabolic conditioning, not power development. | Secondary. Routes to Ultra when conditioning accumulation is the goal; stays in Plus when power output is the goal. |

**Color drives Ultra format more than any other Type:**
- 🟠 Circuit → station rotation, no barbells, tissue rotation between stations
- 🔴 Intense → maximum interval effort, reduced rest, AMRAP structure
- ⚪ Mindful → Zone 2, conversational pace, somatic attention during movement
- 🟢 Bodyweight → park runs, bodyweight conditioning circuits, jump rope
- 🔵 Structured → prescribed intervals with defined work/rest ratios, trackable
- 🟣 Technical → movement quality focus during conditioning (running gait, rowing technique), extended warm-up and cool-down

### Axis Interaction Matrix

| Axis | Selection Bias for Ultra |
|------|-------------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Steady-state rowing, treadmill running, stationary cycling. The foundational cardio modalities — proven, bilateral, measurable. |
| 🔨 Functional | Sled push/pull, battle rope, farmer's carry as conditioning, agility drills with athletic transfer intent. Real-world cardiovascular demand. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Zone 2 for recovery quality, mobility flow sequences, swimming for full-ROM cardiovascular work, the experience of sustained aerobic movement. Feeling the breath rhythm. |
| 🪐 Challenge | Sprint intervals at maximum output, 2km row PR attempt, maximum-effort Assault bike Tabata, timed agility test. The hardest sustainable pace at any level. |
| ⌛ Time | EMOM rowing, AMRAP circuit, Tabata, timed interval structure. ⌛ is especially natural with ➖ Ultra because time is the fundamental variable in all aerobic training. |
| 🐬 Partner | Relay races, tandem rowing (if available), partner sprint races, synchronized conditioning circuits, relay station rotation. |

### Color Equipment Interaction

- **⚫ Teaching (Tier 2–3):** Rowing machine technique, running form cues, heart rate zone education. Comprehension over exertion. No sprint efforts.
- **🟢 Bodyweight (Tier 0–2):** Park run, bodyweight circuit, jump rope, mountain climbers, burpees (as conditioning). No equipment required. Maximum accessibility.
- **🔵 Structured (Tier 2–3):** Programmed 5km run with defined pacing, prescribed rowing intervals with tracked splits, documented cycling watts.
- **🟣 Technical (Tier 2–5):** Running gait analysis session, rowing technique focus, precise interval execution with extended rest between efforts for full quality maintenance.
- **🔴 Intense (Tier 2–4):** Maximum effort intervals. Sprint repeats, assault bike for time, AMRAP conditioning circuits. The conditioning modality pushed toward maximum sustainable output.
- **🟠 Circuit (Tier 0–3):** Timed conditioning stations. No barbells. Loop logic applies — each station must change metabolic demand or tissue dominance. Battle rope → box step → jump rope → row → repeat.
- **🟡 Fun (Tier 0–5):** Recreational sport as conditioning, obstacle course-style cardio, varied modality exploration, movement games.
- **⚪ Mindful (Tier 0–3):** Zone 2 jogging with breath attention, slow cycling, tai chi-influenced movement flows, 30-minute walk. Somatic quality during sustained low-intensity work.

### Order Fit

- **⛽ Strength:** Ultra is uncommon in ⛽. Strength training and cardiovascular work compete for energy system priority. Where it fits: short sprint intervals as CNS primers (before strength work), heavy sled push as loaded conditioning.
- **🦋 Hypertrophy:** Ultra intersects in 🦋 through metabolic conditioning and circuit work that accumulates training stress through volume rather than load. AMRAP finishers, high-rep conditioning circuits.
- **🏟 Performance:** Ultra is highly natural in 🏟. The 2km row test, the 1-mile run time trial, the VO2 max test, the 5km PR. Energy system testing is performance testing.
- **🐂 Foundation:** Aerobic base building. Zone 2 work. Learning to maintain pace and manage exertion. Running mechanics at low intensity.
- **🌾 Full Body:** Ultra in 🌾 context = conditioning-dominant flow. The full-body movement must be continuous — a rowing piece, a complex barbell flow, a running circuit where the conditioning is the point.
- **⚖ Balance:** ⚖➖ = energy system gaps and aerobic base deficiencies. The person who can squat 400 pounds but can't sustain a 20-minute row. The aerobic base is the gap being corrected.
- **🖼 Restoration:** ⚖➖ in restoration mode = nervous system regulation. Zone 2 recovery run, 30-minute easy cycle, mobility flows, breath-focused movement. The cardiovascular system slowing down, not working harder.

### The Ultra Direction

Ultra is subtraction. The ➖ sign is not negation — it is reduction to the essential. You strip away the variations, the angles, the load selection, the tissue-specific targeting. What remains is: can the body sustain work over time? Ultra asks the system question, not the part question. The cardiovascular system is the whole-body infrastructure — it supplies every muscle, every organ, every rep in every other workout. Training Ultra is not training cardio as an afterthought. It is maintaining the plumbing that the rest of the system depends on. Plus Ultra: ➕ and ➖ together. Addition and subtraction. Power and endurance. Integration and efficiency. The full range of what lies beyond Push, Pull, and Legs.

## Cross-Type Reference

### The Classical Split and Its Extensions

| Type | Classical Split | Extended Function |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| 🛒 Push | Day 1: Chest/Shoulders/Triceps | Expression of force away from the body |
| 🪡 Pull | Day 2: Back/Biceps | Reception of force toward the body |
| 🍗 Legs | Day 3: Legs | Ground contact and foundation |
| ➕ Plus | — (not in classical split) | Integration: parts operating as one system |
| ➖ Ultra | — (not in classical split) | Efficiency: the infrastructure beneath all other types |

The classical 3-day split was a valid organizing framework when the gym was the whole context. PPL± adds Plus and Ultra because:

1. Power production (Olympic lifts, plyometrics, loaded carries) cannot be cleanly assigned to a single body-part day without losing its identity.
2. Cardiovascular capacity is not an accessory to resistance training. It is a co-equal system that requires dedicated training investment.

### Muscle Overlap and Boundary Clarity

| Muscle/Pattern | Primary Type | Secondary Type | Routing Rule |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Deadlift (barbell) | 🪡 Pull | 🍗 Legs | Posterior chain and hip hinge → Pull |
| RDL | 🪡 Pull | 🍗 Legs | Hip hinge, hamstring eccentric → Pull |
| Leg curl | 🍗 Legs | 🪡 Pull | Knee flexion, hamstring isolation → Legs |
| Nordic curl | 🍗 Legs | 🪡 Pull | Hamstring eccentrics at the knee → Legs |
| Hip thrust | 🍗 Legs | 🪡 Pull | Glute max as primary, no bar movement up from floor → Legs |
| Barbell row | 🪡 Pull | — | Lat and upper back → Pull |
| Power clean | ➕ Plus | 🪡 Pull | Integration of posterior chain + receiving position → Plus |
| KB swing | ➕ Plus | 🪡 Pull | Full posterior chain as a power unit → Plus |
| Rowing machine (conditioning) | ➖ Ultra | 🪡 Pull | Energy system goal → Ultra |
| Rowing machine (hypertrophy) | 🪡 Pull | — | Tissue development goal → Pull |
| Med ball slam | ➕ Plus | ➖ Ultra | Explosive full-body integration → Plus |
| Box jump (power) | ➕ Plus | 🍗 Legs | Power production → Plus |
| Box jump (conditioning) | ➖ Ultra | ➕ Plus | Metabolic accumulation → Ultra |

**The routing rule in one sentence:** Assign the Type based on the training intent, not the equipment or the muscles involved. The same exercise at different intents can route to different Types.

### Order × Type Notable Interactions

| Order | Type | Notable Constraint or Character |
|-------|------|--------------------------------|
| 🏟 Performance | ➕ Plus | The natural home for Olympic lifts. 1RM clean, snatch, jerk. Test and leave. |
| 🏟 Performance | ➖ Ultra | Time trials. 2km row, 1-mile run, VO2 test. No junk conditioning after the test. |
| 🖼 Restoration | ➕ Plus | Core becomes the breath system. Diaphragm, TVA, pelvic floor, not loaded carries. |
| 🖼 Restoration | ➖ Ultra | Nervous system regulation. Zone 2, mobility flows, somatic breath work. |
| 🖼 Restoration | 🛒 Push | Shoulder mobility and thoracic extension. Not pressing. |
| 🖼 Restoration | 🪡 Pull | Posterior chain tension release. Not rowing. |
| ⚖ Balance | ➕ Plus | Anti-rotation and rotational stability. The core integration gaps. |
| ⚖ Balance | ➖ Ultra | Aerobic base deficiency. The cardio gap being corrected. |
| 🌾 Full Body | ➕ Plus | Highest natural alignment. The unity test is native to Plus exercises. |

## Open Questions

- Should Section L (Kettlebell) have an explicit Type assignment per exercise, or remain context-determined by movement pattern? The current "determined by movement pattern" rule is flexible but creates routing decisions at generation time.
- The ➖ Ultra / 🖼 Restoration boundary in mobility flows: when does a mobility flow route to Ultra (as conditioning) vs. staying in Restoration (as recovery)? Current rule: if the cardiovascular system is the training target, it's Ultra; if the nervous system is the target, it's Restoration.
- The rowing machine ambiguity (noted above) — should generation notes explicitly state the intent-routing rule for dual-use cardio equipment? This is currently implied but not explicit in scl-directory.md.
- Does ➕ Plus have a natural aesthetic lens (🌹)? The aesthetic axis in Plus territory might surface Turkish get-up quality, the beauty of a well-executed snatch, the kinesthetic experience of a perfect power clean — but this is harder to operationalize than cable fly aesthetics in Push.
