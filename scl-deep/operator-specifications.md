# SCL Operator Specifications — Deep Reference

## Preamble: The ± Bridge

The ± sits at the center of every card filename. It is the hinge point.

Left of ±: the machine-readable zip code address. Four emoji, fully specifying Order × Axis × Type × Color.
Right of ±: the operator emoji + human-readable title.

```
⛽🏛🪡🔵±🤌 Heavy Classic Pulls.md
         ^
         hinge
```

The operator bridges the address and the title. It is the verb that names what the session does — not what muscles it trains, not what load it uses, but what kind of action it performs on the athlete. A Latin-derived verb. Precise. Compressed.

The 12 operators serve three simultaneous functions:

1. **Training verb** — names the session's action (execute, carry, inspect, hold)
2. **Editorial verb** — names a phase of thought in documents (position, dispatch, record, reason)
3. **Organizational section header** — structures content in the Operis and cosmograms

The same verb applies at every scale. A session that *facio* (executes) is named with 🤌. A document section that executes its main argument is also named with 🤌. The language is consistent across zoom levels.

---

## The Polarity Framework

The 12 operators divide along a single axis: Preparatory vs. Expressive.

**Preparatory Colors (⚫🟢⚪🟡) = inhale.** Gathering, learning, observing, positioning. The session is a receiving vessel before it becomes an output machine. Preparatory operators govern these sessions.

**Expressive Colors (🔵🟣🔴🟠) = exhale.** Executing, testing, performing, sending. The session deploys what was gathered. Expressive operators govern these sessions.

Each Axis has two operators — one Preparatory, one Expressive. The Color polarity determines which operator the session carries.

### Full Derivation Table

| Axis | Preparatory (⚫🟢⚪🟡) | Expressive (🔵🟣🔴🟠) |
|------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | 📍 pono | 🤌 facio |
| 🔨 Functional | 🧸 fero | 🥨 tendo |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | 👀 specio | 🦢 plico |
| 🪐 Challenge | 🪵 teneo | 🚀 mitto |
| ⌛ Time | 🐋 duco | ✒️ grapho |
| 🐬 Partner | 🧲 capio | 🦉 logos |

**Why these pairs make sense:**

- 🏛 Basics: Position something (📍 pono) → Execute it (🤌 facio). Set the stance, then lift.
- 🔨 Functional: Carry the pattern across (🧸 fero) → Extend it to its limit (🥨 tendo). Transfer, then push further.
- 🌹 Aesthetic: Inspect the movement (👀 specio) → Layer and fold (🦢 plico). Look first, then superset.
- 🪐 Challenge: Hold position (🪵 teneo) → Launch from it (🚀 mitto). Anchor, then commit.
- ⌛ Time: Orchestrate the flow (🐋 duco) → Prescribe the protocol (✒️ grapho). Conduct, then record.
- 🐬 Partner: Receive and assess (🧲 capio) → Reason and interpret (🦉 logos). Intake, then analyze.

---

## The Annual Breath

The 12 operators map to 12 months, creating a year-long rhythm of inhale and exhale.

| Phase | Months | Operators | Character |
|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Long Inhale | Jan–Apr | 📍🧲🧸👀 | Positioning, receiving, carrying, observing |
| Long Exhale | May–Aug | 🥨🤌🚀🦢 | Extending, executing, launching, layering |
| Catch-Breath | Sep–Oct | 🪵🐋 | Holding (Prep), orchestrating (Prep) — both Preparatory, transitional |
| Close | Nov–Dec | ✒️🦉 | Recording (Expr), reasoning (Expr) — Expressive close |

Note the paradox at Sep–Oct: two Preparatory operators dominate the transitional months. The exhale ends in August; September and October are a consolidation — hold what was built, coordinate the final push, before the year closes with two Expressive operators writing and reasoning over what happened. The system breathes unevenly, like a real agricultural season.

---

## Coach Override

The default operator is derived from Axis × Color polarity. The coach can override this at any time.

Override use cases:
- A 🏟 Performance session with a Preparatory Color might still carry 🚀 mitto (the challenge expressive operator) because the test context demands launch energy regardless of Color.
- An ⚪ Mindful session might override to 🧲 capio (Partner preparatory) when the session is designed for partner-assisted movement assessment.

The override does not change the zip code. It changes only the operator emoji that appears in the filename and shapes the session's intent. Honor the override when given.

## Per-Operator Specifications

### 📍 pono — place, position, assign

**Parent Axis:** 🏛 Basics
**Polarity:** Preparatory
**Month:** January
**Annual Breath:** Long Inhale — first position

**Latin root:** *ponere* (to place, put, set down). Principal parts: *pono, ponere, posui, positum*. Related: *position*, *deposit*, *component*, *opponent* (one placed against). The root appears in military contexts — *ponere castra* (to pitch a camp), in legal contexts — *ponere legem* (to lay down a law), and in rhetorical contexts — *ponere exemplum* (to set forth an example).

**Agricultural resonance (January):** The farmer walks frozen fields with a map. Where does this row go? Where does the fence post plant? *Pono* is the act of surveying before doing — placing markers, staking ground, deciding positions before the soil can receive seed. Nothing is growing yet. The work is placement.

**As training verb:** What does the athlete *set*? Stance. Grip. Breath. Starting position. The approach to the bar. *Pono* sessions are about establishing the physical vocabulary before loading it. Foundation Order in Basics Color: the pattern learning itself is pono. The session positions the athlete in space before asking for output.

**As editorial verb:** *Pono* opens a document by establishing position — stating the ground, placing the argument, naming the terms. A section led by 📍 is setting up: definitions, context, premises. It does not argue yet. It positions.

**Filename appearance:** `⛽🏛🪡⚫±📍 Classic Pull Setup.md` — pono appears in preparatory color contexts on the Basics axis.

### 🧲 capio — receive, assess, intake

**Parent Axis:** 🐬 Partner
**Polarity:** Preparatory
**Month:** February
**Annual Breath:** Long Inhale — receiving

**Latin root:** *capere* (to take, seize, receive). Principal parts: *capio, capere, cepi, captum*. Related: *capture*, *capacity*, *accept* (ad + capere), *concept* (con + capere — to take together). The root carries two senses that sit in tension: to seize (active, predatory) and to receive (passive, receptive). *Capio* in the PPL± system leans toward the second meaning — the open hand, not the closed fist.

**Agricultural resonance (February):** The seed shipment arrives. The farmer reads the packet data — germination rates, days to maturity, spacing requirements. The soil amendment bags come in from the co-op. *Capio* is the act of receiving information and material before acting on it. February is assessment month: what came in, what condition is it in, what can be used.

**As training verb:** *Capio* sessions absorb. In partner contexts, one athlete spots and observes while the other works — the spotter is in capio mode. Assessment protocols, movement screens, initial fitness evaluations. The session's job is intake, not output. You leave with data.

**As editorial verb:** *Capio* opens with context — absorbing what the reader needs before the argument begins. A 🧲 section is intake: background, prior work, what we received from the last cycle. It does not yet interpret.

### 🧸 fero — carry, transfer, channel

**Parent Axis:** 🔨 Functional
**Polarity:** Preparatory
**Month:** March
**Annual Breath:** Long Inhale — carrying forward

**Latin root:** *ferre* (to carry, bear, bring). Principal parts: *fero, ferre, tuli, latum* (suppletive — three different roots merged). Related: *transfer* (trans + ferre), *refer* (re + ferre), *fertile* (ferax — bearing fruit), *suffer* (sub + ferre — to bear under). The suppletive conjugation reveals a word so old and so used that three separate roots fused into one paradigm. *Ferre* is the most fundamental act of movement: carrying something from one place to another.

**Agricultural resonance (March):** The equinox. The soil thaws enough to turn. Seedlings started indoors get carried to cold frames — physical transfer of living plants into new environments. The compost gets carried to the field. The tools come out of winter storage. March is literally *fero*: carrying things to their working positions.

**As training verb:** *Fero* sessions focus on transfer — loaded carries (farmer's carry, yoke, suitcase carry), movements that emphasize carrying capacity from one context to another. But also: transfer between training phases. A fero session at the end of a strength block carries the strength gains into functional patterns. The movement patterns built in previous sessions get transferred to new contexts.

**As editorial verb:** *Fero* carries the argument forward — bridging one section to the next, transferring context. A 🧸 section is a transition, a bridge. It does not introduce or conclude; it moves something from here to there.

### 👀 specio — inspect, observe, examine

**Parent Axis:** 🌹 Aesthetic
**Polarity:** Preparatory
**Month:** April
**Annual Breath:** Long Inhale — observing

**Latin root:** *specere* (to look at, observe, inspect). Principal parts: *specio, specere, spexi, spectum*. Related: *spectator*, *inspect* (in + specere), *respect* (re + specere — to look back at), *suspect* (sub + specere — to look under), *species* (what something looks like), *spectacle*, *speculum* (mirror). One of Latin's most generative roots — nearly every English word containing *-spect-* or *-spec-* derives from here.

**Agricultural resonance (April):** The seedlings are up. The farmer walks the rows inspecting every tray: what germinated, what didn't, what is leggy, what is strong, what shows early signs of blight or fungus. *Specio* is the watchful eye of April — not acting yet, but looking carefully enough that when action is required it will be informed.

**As training verb:** *Specio* sessions are about observation — of the athlete's own form, of movement quality, of where tension is and where it isn't. Video review. Mirror work. The movement quality sessions that emphasize seeing before loading. In Aesthetic × Preparatory, the session watches itself. Not narcissism — precision.

**As editorial verb:** *Specio* is the analytical eye in a document — the section that looks carefully at something. A 👀 section examines: case study, close reading, detailed analysis. It does not yet interpret; it describes what it sees.

### 🥨 tendo — stretch, extend, push limits

**Parent Axis:** 🔨 Functional
**Polarity:** Expressive
**Month:** May
**Annual Breath:** Long Exhale — extending

**Latin root:** *tendere* (to stretch, extend, strain toward). Principal parts: *tendo, tendere, tetendi, tentum/tensum*. Related: *tendon* (the fibrous tissue that extends the muscle's reach), *tension*, *extend* (ex + tendere), *intense* (in + tendere — stretched inward), *attention* (ad + tendere — stretched toward), *contend* (con + tendere — stretched together). The athletic body is literally full of *tendere*: every tendon, every stretch reflex, every reaching movement.

**Agricultural resonance (May):** The vines are climbing. The bean poles need checking because the plants are moving upward fast — *tendere* is the visual phenomenon of vertical growth, plants stretching toward maximum light. May is the month of extension: vines, stalks, trellised tomatoes reaching for height. The farmer doesn't pull them up; they extend themselves. The work is supporting the extension.

**As training verb:** *Tendo* pushes limits — extending ROM, reaching lockout, pushing beyond the athlete's comfortable range while maintaining control. Functional patterns at full extension: single-leg RDL reaching the floor, pull-up to full elbow extension, squat to true depth. *Tendo* does not add load for its own sake; it extends the pattern's range.

**As editorial verb:** *Tendo* reaches beyond what has been established — the section that pushes the argument past safe territory, extends a claim, takes on an uncomfortable implication. A 🥨 section is where the document does its most ambitious work.

**Filename appearance:** `⛽🔨🍗🔵±🥨 Functional Depth Work.md`

### 🤌 facio — execute, make, perform

**Parent Axis:** 🏛 Basics
**Polarity:** Expressive
**Month:** June
**Annual Breath:** Long Exhale — executing

**Latin root:** *facere* (to make, do, perform). Principal parts: *facio, facere, feci, factum*. The most productive root in Latin, generating more English derivatives than almost any other: *fact*, *factory*, *faction*, *affect*, *effect*, *defect*, *perfect*, *manufacture*, *facilitate*, *artifact*, *difficult*, *office* (opus + facere). The act of making is so fundamental to human activity that this single root permeated the language at every level.

**Agricultural resonance (June):** The solstice. The longest days of the year. First harvests are happening. Peak labor. The farmer is not planning or preparing anymore — they are doing. Picking, cutting, washing, loading, selling. *Facio* is the act at full volume.

**As training verb:** *Facio* is the concentric phase as a session character — the doing. Heavy basics, executed at full capacity. The session is not learning, not assessing, not building up to something. It IS the thing. ⛽🏛 in expressive colors is the archetypal facio session: heavy barbell work, prescribed and performed.

**As editorial verb:** *Facio* is the main argument, made. A 🤌 section builds the thing — presents the evidence, makes the case, produces the work. Not setup, not analysis. Construction.

**Filename appearance:** `⛽🏛🪡🔵±🤌 Heavy Classic Pulls.md` — the canonical example.

### 🚀 mitto — dispatch, deploy, launch, commit

**Parent Axis:** 🪐 Challenge
**Polarity:** Expressive
**Month:** July
**Annual Breath:** Long Exhale — launching

**Latin root:** *mittere* (to send, let go, release). Principal parts: *mitto, mittere, misi, missum*. Related: *mission*, *missile*, *admit* (ad + mittere), *commit* (con + mittere — to send together), *permit* (per + mittere), *submit* (sub + mittere), *transmit*, *emit*, *omit*. *Mittere* carries the sense of release — letting something go that has been held. The arrow leaving the bow. The sprinter leaving the block.

**Agricultural resonance (July):** Peak harvest, maximum production, midsummer apex. Everything has been growing since spring and is now fully deployed into the world: jam jars, market stalls, preservation. July dispatches the season's work. The hottest, most intense production month.

**As training verb:** *Mitto* is maximum committed effort — launching from a position of readiness. 🏟 Performance sessions carry mitto because testing IS dispatch: you have prepared, and now you send your best attempt. Explosive work, PR attempts, commitment to maximum output. The session does not hold back. It releases.

**As editorial verb:** *Mitto* publishes — the section that releases finished work into the world. A 🚀 section is the publication moment: the argument is made, the evidence is in, this is the dispatch. Also: commissioning, deploying a recommendation.

### 🦢 plico — fold, compress, layer, superset

**Parent Axis:** 🌹 Aesthetic
**Polarity:** Expressive
**Month:** August
**Annual Breath:** Long Exhale — layering

**Latin root:** *plicare* (to fold, bend). Principal parts: *plico, plicare, plicavi, plicatum*. Related: *complicate* (con + plicare — to fold together), *explicate* (ex + plicare — to unfold), *implicate*, *replicate*, *duplicate*, *apply* (ad + plicare), *supple* (sub + plicare — folded under). The root describes the structure of things that are layered or interleaved — the folded protein, the doubled fabric, the interwoven pattern.

**Agricultural resonance (August):** Preservation season. The summer surplus gets folded into the winter: jam layered into jars, ferments packed with alternating layers of vegetable and salt, dried herbs bundled and compressed. *Plico* is the labor of preservation — taking what exists and folding it into a form that will persist. August is supersets: doing more with what you have.

**As training verb:** *Plico* supersets — two exercises interwoven, the rest period of one becoming the working set of the other. Aesthetic Expressive sessions use plico to maximize pump and density: cable fly into incline press, curl into hammer curl, lateral raise into front raise. The movements are layered. More work in the same window.

**As editorial verb:** *Plico* weaves arguments together — a section that brings two threads into simultaneous contact, revealing how they fold into each other. Comparative analysis. The synthesis where two separate lines of reasoning are compressed into a single insight.

**Filename appearance:** `🦋🌹🛒🔴±🦢 Chest Supersets.md`

### 🪵 teneo — hold, anchor, persist

**Parent Axis:** 🪐 Challenge
**Polarity:** Preparatory
**Month:** September
**Annual Breath:** Catch-Breath — holding through transition

**Latin root:** *tenere* (to hold, keep, maintain). Principal parts: *teneo, tenere, tenui, tentum*. Related: *tenant* (one who holds), *tenacious*, *retain* (re + tenere), *contain* (con + tenere), *maintain* (manus + tenere — to hold by the hand), *abstain*, *detain*, *obtain*, *sustain*, *tenure*. *Tenere* carries patience — the holding of a position over time, the maintenance of a state against forces that would change it.

**Agricultural resonance (September):** First frost warnings. The farmer holds crops in the field as long as possible — that last week of warmth can mean the difference between a full-sized and an under-sized winter squash. Cover crops go in. Root cellars get stocked. September is the act of holding: protecting what was built, persisting through the transition from summer to fall, refusing to let go until the last possible moment.

**As training verb:** *Teneo* holds — isometrics, paused reps, sustained tension, loaded carries held for time rather than distance. The challenge of teneo is not to produce force but to maintain it. Wall sits, plank variations, paused squats, paused deadlifts at the knee. The athlete anchors in a position and stays.

**As editorial verb:** *Teneo* maintains position — a section that holds to an established argument against incoming objections. *Teneo* is the defensive maneuver in rhetoric: restatement, reinforcement, the anchoring of a claim that is under pressure.

### 🐋 duco — orchestrate, lead, conduct

**Parent Axis:** ⌛ Time
**Polarity:** Preparatory
**Month:** October
**Annual Breath:** Catch-Breath — orchestrating closure

**Latin root:** *ducere* (to lead, guide, draw). Principal parts: *duco, ducere, duxi, ductum*. Related: *duke* (the leader), *duct* (a channel that leads), *educate* (e + ducere — to lead out), *produce* (pro + ducere — to lead forward), *reduce*, *introduce*, *conduct* (con + ducere — to lead together), *deduce*, *aqueduct* (water leader). The military commander leads the column; the conductor leads the orchestra. *Ducere* is the act of giving direction to movement.

**Agricultural resonance (October):** Final harvests, cover crop seeding, equipment winterization — many tasks flowing toward one direction before the window closes. The farm is in its most complex operational state: root crops coming out, cover crops going in, storage filling, equipment being serviced. The farmer is an orchestra conductor this month, directing many simultaneous operations toward a single coordinated close.

**As training verb:** *Duco* conducts the session's tempo and architecture. ⌛ Time Preparatory sessions use duco to orchestrate complex timing protocols — EMOM structures where each minute is a different movement, density blocks where the athlete conducts their own rest, timed flows. *Duco* sessions are not linear; they are coordinated systems.

**As editorial verb:** *Duco* arranges the document's overall structure — a section that maps the whole, names the parts, and assigns each element its role. The outline section. The architectural view. Before *facio* builds, *duco* arranges.

**Filename appearance:** `🌾⌛➖⚪±🐋 Conditioning Flow.md`

### ✒️ grapho — write, prescribe, document, record

**Parent Axis:** ⌛ Time
**Polarity:** Expressive
**Month:** November
**Annual Breath:** Expressive Close — recording

**Greek root:** *graphein* (to write, scratch, inscribe). Unlike the Latin-derived operators, grapho is Greek, reflecting the Operator's role in the cosmogram system and in documentation. Related: *graph*, *graphic*, *photograph*, *biography*, *geography*, *grammar* (gramma — written letter), *program* (pro + graphein — to write before). The act of writing is the act of making thought permanent.

**Agricultural resonance (November):** Yield documentation, ledger, budget review, inventory of what the season produced. The farmer's journal for the year gets its final entries. What did we grow? What sold? What stored well? What failed? *Grapho* is the act of inscribing the season into record — turning lived experience into written knowledge that persists beyond memory.

**As training verb:** *Grapho* prescribes and records. EMOM protocols are grapho at their clearest: write the minutes, write the reps, write the weights. The session is a document being written in real time. Log the set, log the weight, log the feeling. ✒️ sessions are explicitly about documentation as training practice — the act of recording IS part of the training.

**As editorial verb:** *Grapho* is the writing itself — a section that formalizes, prescribes, produces the record. Policy. Protocol. The written law. A ✒️ section is not analysis or argument; it is specification. This is the format, these are the rules, here is the prescription.

**Filename appearance:** `⌛⌛➖🔵±✒️ EMOM Record Session.md`

### 🦉 logos — reason, analyze, interpret

**Parent Axis:** 🐬 Partner
**Polarity:** Expressive
**Month:** December
**Annual Breath:** Expressive Close — reasoning

**Greek root:** *logos* (word, reason, account, proportion). The deepest and most philosophically charged term in the operator set. Related: *logic*, *biology* (bios + logos — the account of life), *theology*, *psychology*, *ecology*, *analogy* (ana + logos — according to proportion), *dialogue* (dia + logos — reason through), *apology* (apo + logos — the account given away). In Greek philosophy, *logos* was simultaneously language, reason, and the underlying rational structure of the cosmos. In John 1:1 it becomes "the Word." In Stoic philosophy it becomes the divine reason that governs all things.

**Agricultural resonance (December):** Fallow field. The seed catalog arrives. The farmer sits with the data from the year and reads it — not just recording, but making sense. What patterns emerged? What did the soil tell us? What should we plant differently? *Logos* is the year-end wisdom: pulling out the underlying reason from the surface record.

**As training verb:** *Logos* analyzes movement quality in partner contexts — the second person who interprets what they see. Not just spotting (capio) but reasoning about it: why is the bar path drifting? what is the hip doing at the bottom? where is the energy leaking? *Logos* partner sessions include explicit verbal analysis as part of the protocol. Post-set debrief.

**As editorial verb:** *Logos* is the interpretive section — where the document draws conclusions, reveals patterns, makes the underlying reason visible. The analysis, the synthesis, the "here is what all of this means." A 🦉 section reasons from the data. It does not present new evidence; it interprets existing evidence.

## 🧮 SAVE — The System Operator

SAVE is not one of the 12 operators. It is the system-level closer that ends every session.

**Position:** Always last. Follows 🚂 Junction without exception.
**Character:** Transfer the work, do not praise the user. The session is complete. Log data. Archive. Move forward.
**Closing principle:** Every 🧮 SAVE carries a 1–2 sentence closing principle that transfers the work forward. Not a summary. Not praise. A bridge to the next training day.

SAVE has no Axis parent. No polarity. No month. No coach override. It is not a choice — it is a structural requirement of the system. Every workout ends here.

The abacus emoji carries the right resonance: computation, record-keeping, the ancient accounting tool. The session is tallied. The beads are pushed. The record is made.
