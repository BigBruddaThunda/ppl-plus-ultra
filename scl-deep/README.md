# SCL Deep Specifications

This directory holds the full uncompressed specification layer of the Semantic Compression Language.

## Relationship to scl-directory.md

`scl-directory.md` (repo root) is the compiled operational reference — what Claude reads during workout generation. This directory holds the source specifications that `scl-directory.md` compresses. When documents here are updated, `scl-directory.md` should be recompiled to match.

## Vocabulary Note

The Color Context Vernacular and Order Parameters documents were written when the system used 25 emojis (8 Colors, 7 Orders, 5 Types, 4 Compasses, 1 System). The current SCL uses 61 emojis (8 Colors, 7 Orders, 5 Types, 6 Axes, 22 Blocks, 12 Operators, 1 System). The 4 "Compasses" became 6 "Axes" — the original 4 (🏛 Firmitas, 🔨 Utilitas, 🌹 Venustas, 🪐 Gravitas) were joined by ⌛ Temporitas and 🐬 Sociatas. The 12 Operators and 22 Blocks did not exist in the original documents.

The core ideas in these documents are fully alive in the current system. They need integration, not replacement.
