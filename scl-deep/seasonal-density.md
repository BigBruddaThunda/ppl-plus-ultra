# SEASONAL DENSITY
## The Full Specification of PPL± Seasonal Training Rhythm

The PPL± system has four layers of temporal structure:

1. **Daily:** The weekday Order cycle (7-day, fixed). Monday = 🐂 Foundation always.
2. **Weekly (rolling):** The Type cycle (5-day, never resets for the week). Jan 1 = 🛒, Jan 2 = 🪡, etc.
3. **Monthly:** The Operator/Axis shift (12 per year). February = 🧲 capio / 🐬 Partner axis always.
4. **Seasonal / Annual:** The density breath — the macro periodization arc across the full year.

This document specifies Layer 4: the seasonal density arc.

## SECTION 1: THE FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE

The agricultural year is a periodization model. Farmers do not plant at maximum intensity in January and maintain that intensity through December. The year breathes. High-output periods are bounded by low-output periods. The system recovers so it can produce again.

PPL± maps onto this rhythm not because agriculture is inherently related to training, but because both systems are governed by the same biological constraint: adaptation requires alternating stress and recovery at multiple timescales simultaneously.

Single sessions have a stress-recovery cycle (sets and rest periods).
Training weeks have a stress-recovery cycle (hard days and easy days).
Training months have a stress-recovery cycle (loading blocks and deload weeks).
The training year has a stress-recovery cycle. That cycle is the seasonal arc.

The seasonal arc is the largest timescale in the system. It cannot be felt in one session. It is felt across months.

## SECTION 2: THE FOUR PHASES — FULL SPECIFICATION

### Phase 1: Preparatory Inhale (January–April)

**Operators:** 📍 pono → 🧲 capio → 🧸 fero → 👀 specio
**Polarity:** Preparatory × 4
**Duration:** 4 months
**Breath:** Slow inhale, deepening across the four months

The inhale is progressive. January is the quietest month (📍 pono — set the stance, establish position). April is already observing what's grown (👀 specio — inspect before pushing). The four months are not identical — they form a gradient from deepest preparatory to the threshold of expressive.

**Density parameters:**

| Parameter | January | February | March | April |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|-------|
| Volume relative | Very low | Low | Low-moderate | Moderate |
| Rest bias | Maximum of Order range | Maximum | Standard-high | Standard |
| Dominant Colors | ⚫⚪ | ⚫⚪🟢 | 🟢🔵⚫ | 🔵🟣 |
| GOLD frequency | None | None | Low | Low-moderate |
| Dominant Orders | 🐂🖼 | 🐂⚖🖼 | 🐂⛽ | ⛽🦋 |

**Month character:**
- **January (📍 pono):** The quietest month. Set the stance. Establish 1RM baselines. Identify the patterns that will be developed this year. ⚫ Teaching and ⚪ Mindful dominate. No PRs. No peaks. Position only.
- **February (🧲 capio):** Audit and absorb. Receive what January showed you. Fix what broke. ⚫ Teaching and ⚖ Balance sessions prominent. This is the month for identifying asymmetries before loading them.
- **March (🧸 fero):** Transfer plans into action. First meaningful load progression. 🔵 Structured sessions begin to surface. The inhale deepens. Patterns that were positioned in January and audited in February are now carried into real work.
- **April (👀 specio):** Inspect before the expressive phase begins. 🟣 Technical sessions appropriate — precision before volume. Run a form audit on every major pattern. What degraded over the winter? What's ready to push?

---

### Phase 2: Expressive Exhale (May–August)

**Operators:** 🥨 tendo → 🤌 facio → 🚀 mitto → 🦢 plico
**Polarity:** Expressive × 4
**Duration:** 4 months
**Breath:** Full sustained exhale, peaking in July

The exhale applies what the inhale built. Volume accumulates. Load increases. The GOLD window opens fully. The system is spending what it saved.

**Density parameters:**

| Parameter | May | June | July | August |
|-----------|-----|------|------|--------|
| Volume relative | Moderate-high | High | Peak | High (accumulating) |
| Rest bias | Standard-low | Low end of Order range | Minimum of Order range | Low-standard |
| Dominant Colors | 🔵🟣🔴 | 🔴🟣🔵 | 🔴🟣 | 🔴🟠🦢-heavy |
| GOLD frequency | Moderate | High | Maximum | High |
| Dominant Orders | ⛽🦋 | ⛽🦋🏟 | 🏟⛽ | 🦋⛽ |

**Month character:**
- **May (🥨 tendo):** Extend. Everything pushing limits. Volume increases. 🔵 Structured and 🟣 Technical session density increases. The system is transitioning from preparatory to expressive — the key month where load begins building in earnest.
- **June (🤌 facio):** Execute. Solstice month. Maximum available energy, maximum workload capacity. 🔴 Intense sessions at highest seasonal frequency. PRs are appropriate. GOLD exercises fully in season.
- **July (🚀 mitto):** Maximum output. The apex. 🏟 Performance sessions appropriate for strength tests. GOLD exercises at peak frequency. The send. Commit.
- **August (🦢 plico):** Fold the surplus. Volume accumulation peaks — this is the month with the most total sets across the year. Supersets appropriate in 🦋. The system is compressing gains before the transition. Intensity begins to step down as volume peaks.

---

### Phase 3: Catch-Breath (September–October)

**Operators:** 🪵 teneo → 🐋 duco
**Polarity:** Preparatory × 2
**Duration:** 2 months
**Breath:** Brief inhale between the exhale and the close

The catch-breath prevents Phase 2 gains from degrading while preventing Phase 2 intensity from becoming chronic stress. Hold position. Conduct the transition.

**Density parameters:**

| Parameter | September | October |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Volume relative | Maintenance (step down from August) | Maintenance |
| Rest bias | Standard Order prescription | Standard |
| Dominant Colors | ⚫🔵🟣 | 🟠🔵🟡 |
| GOLD frequency | Low-moderate | Low |
| Dominant Orders | ⛽🦋🌾 | 🌾⚖⛽ |

**Month character:**
- **September (🪵 teneo):** Hold position. Do not add new volume. Run form audits. ⚫ Teaching returns — what degraded during the summer's high-output phase? What needs correction before winter's lower intensity?
- **October (🐋 duco):** Conduct the transition. Many tasks, one direction — closing the active season. 🌾 Full Body sessions appropriate. 🟠 Circuit for movement variety without CNS overreach. The month of orchestrated closure.

---

### Phase 4: Closing (November–December)

**Operators:** ✒️ grapho → 🦉 logos
**Polarity:** Expressive × 2 (but in closing mode — documentation and reasoning, not output)
**Duration:** 2 months
**Breath:** Final exhale before reset

The closing phase is expressive in operator polarity but restorative in training content. The operators (write, reason) apply to logging, reflection, and year-end documentation — not maximum output training.

**Density parameters:**

| Parameter | November | December |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Volume relative | Low | Very low |
| Rest bias | Extended (top of Order range or beyond) | Maximum / intuitive |
| Dominant Colors | ⚫⚪🟢 | ⚪⚫ |
| GOLD frequency | Very low | None |
| Dominant Orders | 🖼⚖🐂 | 🖼🐂 |

**Month character:**
- **November (✒️ grapho):** Write the ledger. What happened this year? The 🚂 Junction logging fields are more important this month than any other. ⚫ Teaching sessions for movement audits across every Type. Volume drops to maintenance-low.
- **December (🦉 logos):** Reason through the data. 🖼 Restoration dominates. ⚪ Mindful Color is most seasonally appropriate. No GOLD. No peaks. December closes quietly. The fallow field. The seed catalog arrives for next year.

## SECTION 3: ALGORITHMIC INPUTS FOR AUTOMATED CONTENT

These inputs govern default Color weighting in the Almanac, Workout of the Day, and default rotation engine when no user override is present.

### Color Polarity Multipliers by Month

The multipliers below weight preparatory and expressive Color selections in automated content generation. A preparatory multiplier of 2.0 means preparatory Colors (⚫🟢⚪🟡) are twice as likely to appear as default recommendations.

| Month | Prep Multiplier | Expr Multiplier | Phase |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| January | 2.0 | 0.5 | Inhale peak |
| February | 1.8 | 0.6 | Inhale |
| March | 1.5 | 0.8 | Inhale |
| April | 1.2 | 1.0 | Inhale threshold |
| May | 0.9 | 1.2 | Exhale entry |
| June | 0.7 | 1.5 | Exhale |
| July | 0.6 | 1.7 | Exhale peak |
| August | 0.7 | 1.5 | Exhale |
| September | 1.1 | 1.0 | Catch-breath |
| October | 1.2 | 0.9 | Catch-breath |
| November | 1.7 | 0.6 | Close |
| December | 2.0 | 0.5 | Close peak |

This produces a smooth sinusoidal density curve across the year, not a step function. January and December are mirror images. The peak expressive window (June–July) is narrower than the peak preparatory window (Jan–Feb, Nov–Dec). The asymmetry is intentional — the quiet bookends the year longer than the intensity.

### Order Weighting by Phase

Within each phase, Order recommendations weight as follows. Higher numbers = more likely to surface as default recommendations.

```
Phase 1 (Jan–Apr): 🐂(2.5) ⛽(1.5) 🦋(1.0) 🏟(0.3) 🌾(1.2) ⚖(1.5) 🖼(2.0)
Phase 2 (May–Aug): 🐂(0.5) ⛽(2.0) 🦋(2.0) 🏟(1.5) 🌾(1.0) ⚖(0.7) 🖼(0.3)
Phase 3 (Sep–Oct): 🐂(1.0) ⛽(1.5) 🦋(1.5) 🏟(0.8) 🌾(1.5) ⚖(1.2) 🖼(0.5)
Phase 4 (Nov–Dec): 🐂(1.5) ⛽(0.8) 🦋(0.7) 🏟(0.2) 🌾(1.0) ⚖(1.5) 🖼(2.5)
```

These weights are inputs to the recommendation engine, not hard constraints. A ⛽ Strength session in December is not wrong. The weight system surfaces different content in different seasons — it does not block any content in any season.

## SECTION 4: HEMISPHERE CONSIDERATIONS

The current seasonal density specification is Northern Hemisphere. The PPL± agricultural rationale maps onto:
- Northern Hemisphere growing season: March–September
- Northern Hemisphere dormant season: November–February
- Northern Hemisphere peak output: June–August

For Southern Hemisphere users, the calendar inverts:
- January = mid-summer (expressive peak)
- July = mid-winter (preparatory inhale)
- Growing season: September–March

**Two implementation options:**

**Option A — Single global calendar (current default):**
All users follow the same seasonal arc regardless of hemisphere. The seasonal density is a design choice rooted in the Northern Hemisphere agricultural tradition. Southern Hemisphere users follow the same tonal calendar. Community coherence is preserved. The system does not bifurcate.

*Rationale for Option A:* The seasonal calendar serves as cultural coherence and shared rhythm, not as climate prescription. A Southern Hemisphere user following the Northern calendar is participating in the same annual story as every other user. The mismatch is acknowledged, not ignored.

**Option B — Hemisphere-aware calendar:**
Users set their hemisphere in profile settings. The monthly operator calendar flips 6 months for Southern Hemisphere users. July becomes 🤌 facio (the June of the Northern calendar). January becomes 🚀 mitto (the July of the Northern calendar).

*Rationale for Option B:* A South African user who goes into winter in June is experiencing the same training context as a Canadian user in December. The seasonal arc should reflect lived experience, not calendar convention.

This is an open design decision. Option A is simpler to implement and preserves community coherence. Option B is more physiologically accurate and respects Southern Hemisphere users' actual seasonal context.

---

## SECTION 5: INTERACTION WITH USER OVERRIDES

The seasonal density layer is always subordinate to user intent. A user running 🔴 Intense sessions in December is not wrong — they are making a valid training choice. The system supports this without friction.

The seasonal layer operates at three levels:

**Level 1 — Default recommendation bias:** What surfaces first in Almanac and WOD when the user has not made a selection. The Color and Order weights in Section 3 govern this.

**Level 2 — Contextual notation:** A light informational note available to users who want to understand why the system is suggesting what it's suggesting. "December — the system leans toward restoration this month. You're running Intense — noted." Not a warning. Not friction. Just context.

**Level 3 — Long-term pattern flag:** If a user chronically overrides the seasonal defaults in the same direction (e.g., never takes any restoration phase across an entire year), the system notes this as a pattern worth surfacing. Not as an intervention — as information. "You haven't run a restoration session in 4 months. The seasonal default has been suggesting them since November." The user decides what to do with this.

The seasonal layer never blocks user selection. It informs. The user governs.

---

## SECTION 6: PERSONAL PERIODIZATION OVERRIDES

The seasonal arc assumes no externally imposed performance calendar. A powerlifter peaking for a November meet needs August-level intensity in October — the opposite of what the seasonal arc recommends.

The system needs a **personal peak** override that temporarily suppresses seasonal defaults and instead surfaces content appropriate to the user's competition calendar. This is Phase 6+ functionality. The mechanism:

1. User declares a peak date (competition or event)
2. System calculates a reverse-engineered periodization arc from that date
3. Seasonal density defaults are suspended N weeks before the peak
4. Personal periodization arc takes precedence
5. Seasonal defaults resume N weeks after the peak (recovery phase)

The personal peak override is seeded here but not implemented in Phase 2–5.

---

## OPEN QUESTIONS

1. **Hemisphere implementation:** Option A (single global) vs. Option B (hemisphere-aware flip). See Section 4.
2. **Personal peak override:** Mechanism for competition calendar conflicts. See Section 6.
3. **Visual design integration:** How strongly does the seasonal layer influence the design system? Muted palette in December, kinetic palette in July — how much visual weight does this carry?
4. **Year 2+ Type cycle drift:** The 5-day Type cycle and 7-day Order cycle diverge. By year 2, January starts on a different Order-Type pairing than year 1. Does the seasonal density layer account for this drift, or does it treat January as January regardless of the Type cycle position?
5. **Editorial content coordination:** The monthly operator calendar connects to food, lifestyle, and seasonal rhythm content. The training seasonal arc and the editorial seasonal arc need to stay coherent. This is an editorial layer decision beyond the training specification.
6. **Deload integration:** Should the seasonal arc explicitly program deload weeks (e.g., a deload in late August before the catch-breath, and another in late December before the year reset)? Currently deloads are implicit in the Phase 3 and Phase 4 density parameters but not explicitly programmed.
