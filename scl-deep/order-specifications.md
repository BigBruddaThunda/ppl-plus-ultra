# SCL Order Specifications — Deep Reference

## Preamble: The Order is the Law

The Order occupies Position 1 in the 4-dial zip code. It is not a suggestion. It is not a preference. It is the ceiling — the highest constraint in the system. When the other three dials conflict with the Order, the Order wins. Every time.

**The constraint hierarchy:**
1. ORDER — Hard ceiling. Nothing exceeds it. Ever.
2. COLOR — Hard filter. Equipment is binary.
3. AXIS — Soft bias. Ranks exercises, does not exclude.
4. Equipment — Practical filter. What is actually available.

The Order is the ceiling. The ceiling does not bend.

**What the Order sets:**
- Load as percentage of 1RM (the ceiling, never a floor)
- Rep range (the band of valid reps — not a fixed number)
- Rest periods (minimum and maximum)
- Maximum difficulty on a 5-point scale
- CNS demand level
- Block count for the session
- Permissible blocks (some blocks hard-exclude under certain Orders)

**What the Order does not set:**
- Which exercises (that's Axis + Type)
- Which equipment (that's Color)
- Session format (that's Color)
- Exercise character (that's Axis)

---

## The Order Ceiling Principle

If any of the following conditions are violated, the zip code is invalid regardless of what the other dials say:

| Order | Load ceiling | Rep floor | Difficulty ceiling | Block count |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 🐂 Foundation | ≤65% | 8 | 2/5 | 4–6 |
| ⛽ Strength | 75–85% | 4 | 4/5 | 5–6 |
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | 65–75% | 8 | 3/5 | 6–7 |
| 🏟 Performance | 85–100%+ | 1 | 5/5 | 3–4 |
| 🌾 Full Body | ~70% | 8 | 3/5 | 5–6 |
| ⚖ Balance | ~70% | 10 | 3/5 | 5–6 |
| 🖼 Restoration | ≤55% | 12 | 2/5 | 4–5 |

These ceilings are absolute. A 🐂 workout with 70% load is not a Foundation workout. It is an invalid card. A 🏟 workout with 5 supplemental blocks after the test violates Performance. It is an invalid card.

---

## Per-Order Specifications

---

### 🐂 Foundation

**Load:** ≤65% 1RM
**Reps:** 8–15
**Rest:** 60–90 seconds
**Max Difficulty:** 2/5
**CNS Demand:** Low

#### Character

Pattern learning at sub-maximal load. Foundation is the on-ramp for any new skill at any level — not beginner-only. A 20-year lifter learning Olympic lifts uses 🐂. A competitive powerlifter returning from surgery uses 🐂. An advanced athlete learning a new movement pattern uses 🐂.

The 🐂 character: the work is about building the neural map, not challenging the ceiling. Fatigue is acceptable but not the goal. Understanding is the goal.

#### What Foundation Is Not

- Not a warm-up. It is a complete training session.
- Not beginner-only. The Order specifies load relationship, not experience level.
- Not a rest day. It is intentional sub-maximal work.
- Not easy. At 65% with correct technique, patterns are challenged at the level where technique holds. The ceiling is the challenge.

#### Block Sequence

```
♨️ → 🔢/🛠 → 🧈 → 🧩 → 🧬 → 🚂 → 🧮
```

- ♨️ Warm-Up: extended; movement vocabulary, mobility
- 🔢 Fundamentals or 🛠 Craft: the educational core; re-grounding in pattern basics
- 🧈 Bread & Butter: sub-maximal compound(s) at 50–65%; pattern emphasis
- 🧩 Supplemental: supporting accessory work; also sub-maximal
- 🧬 Imprint: high-rep, minimal load; locking in the pattern
- 🚂 Junction + 🧮 SAVE

#### Exercise Selection (Foundation filter)

- Prefer the simpler variation over the complex: goblet squat over front squat, trap bar deadlift over sumo, dumbbell press over barbell when learning
- Prefer bilateral over unilateral when pattern is new
- Technical complexity must stay within difficulty ceiling (2/5) — no Olympic lifts, no advanced plyometrics, no ballistic loading
- Full ROM at every rep; technique is the deliverable, not load

#### Foundation × Axis Interactions

| Axis | Foundation Expression |
|------|----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Classic patterns at teaching loads. Barbell squat, row, press — but with coaching precision. |
| 🔨 Functional | Unilateral patterns introduced systematically. Split squat before Bulgarian. Single-arm row before unilateral carries. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Isolation work with full ROM focus. Mind-muscle connection built at low load. |
| 🪐 Challenge | The hardest variation the athlete can execute with perfect technique at 65% or less. Challenge within the ceiling — not a contradiction. |
| ⌛ Time | Timed pattern work. EMOM at sustainable weight. Technique under time pressure. |
| 🐬 Partner | Partner drills for feedback. Spotting, cuing, mirror work. Partner as coaching tool. |

#### Foundation × Color Interactions

| Color | Foundation Expression |
|-------|----------------------|
| ⚫ Teaching | Maximum educational density. Extended rest for comprehension. Coach talk between sets. |
| 🟢 Bodyweight | Bodyweight-only Foundation. Squats, push-ups, rows on rings or bar. No load = full pattern focus. |
| 🔵 Structured | Prescribed progressive overload starting at low loads. Week 1: 50%, Week 2: 55%, etc. |
| 🟣 Technical | Precision focus: few exercises, many sets, long rest, quality obsession. |
| 🔴 Intense | Volume Foundation — higher rep, shorter rest, still within 65% ceiling. |
| 🟠 Circuit | Multi-pattern circuit at very low loads. Loop logic applies. |
| 🟡 Fun | Variety within Foundation: try new movements at safe loads. |
| ⚪ Mindful | Slow tempo Foundation: 4-count eccentrics at 40–55%. Pure tension awareness. |

#### Common Foundation Errors

- **Load creep:** Training at 68% and calling it Foundation. The ceiling is 65%. Every percent matters.
- **Skipping 🧬:** The imprint block locks in the pattern. Cutting it to save time wastes the session's educational investment.
- **Wrong exercises:** Placing Olympic lifts in Foundation. GOLD exercises are gated by Color, not Order — but the difficulty ceiling (2/5) makes most GOLD exercises incompatible.
- **Treating it as a warm-up:** Foundation is a complete session. It has 🧈 as its center. It ends with 🚂 and 🧮.

---

### ⛽ Strength

**Load:** 75–85% 1RM
**Reps:** 4–6
**Rest:** 3–4 minutes
**Max Difficulty:** 4/5
**CNS Demand:** High

#### Character

Neural adaptation. Heavy loads, low reps, full recovery. Force production is the goal. Not bodybuilding. The pump is irrelevant here — if the pump matters, it's 🦋, not ⛽.

⛽ trains the nervous system's ability to recruit and coordinate motor units at high intensity. The rest periods are not optional — 3–4 minutes is the minimum time for phosphocreatine resynthesis after high-intensity work. Shortening rest compromises neural recovery and makes the next set a different, less valuable stimulus.

#### What Strength Is Not

- Not hypertrophy with heavier weight. Different adaptations, different physiology.
- Not performance testing. 🏟 is the test. ⛽ is the training.
- Not a race. Full rest is not laziness — it is the mechanism.
- Not applicable to isolation exercises as the primary work. The CNS demand requires compound movements.

#### Block Sequence

```
♨️ → ▶️ → 🧈 → 🧩 → 🪫 → 🚂 → 🧮
```

- ♨️ Warm-Up: pattern rehearsal at 40–60%, brief
- ▶️ Primer: CNS activation; speed sets at 50–60% before moving to working weight
- 🧈 Bread & Butter: 3–5 sets × 4–6 reps at 75–85%; this is the session's entire purpose
- 🧩 Supplemental: accessory compounds; Romanian deadlift after deadlift, rows after bench; sub-maximal
- 🪫 Release: transition to recovery; stretching, tissue work, breathing
- 🚂 Junction + 🧮 SAVE

#### Progressive Overload Structure (Strength)

Classic strength progression follows a weekly micro-periodization:
- Week 1: 5 × 5 at 75%
- Week 2: 4 × 4 at 80%
- Week 3: 3 × 3 at 85%
- Week 4: deload / test → 🏟

The 🔵 Structured Color makes this explicit. Other Colors vary the format while honoring the load/rep ceiling.

#### Exercise Selection (Strength filter)

- Compound movements dominate 🧈: squat, deadlift, bench, row, press, pull
- Difficulty up to 4/5 is valid: paused squats, tempo pulls, competition-stance work
- No GOLD exercises unless 🔴 or 🟣 Color (and even then, Olympic lifts at 75–85% require elite competence)
- 🧩 can include some isolation but compound accessories are more effective for neural adaptation

#### Strength × Axis Interactions

| Axis | Strength Expression |
|------|-------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | The quintessential Strength axis. Barbell squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, barbell row. Heavy and bilateral. |
| 🔨 Functional | Heavy unilateral: Bulgarian split squat, single-arm dumbbell row, single-leg deadlift. Athletic Strength. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Heavy-ish isolation with full ROM: incline dumbbell press, cable row, dumbbell curls at working weights. |
| 🪐 Challenge | Hardest Strength variations: paused squats, deficit deadlifts, close-grip bench, spoto press. |
| ⌛ Time | EMOM Strength: 1 rep every 90 seconds × 10 minutes. Built-in rest structure. |
| 🐬 Partner | Spottable strength: bench press, squat. Partners enable true limit attempts. |

#### Strength × Color Interactions

| Color | Strength Expression |
|-------|-------------------|
| ⚫ Teaching | Coaching cues on heavy movement patterns. Extended rest. Technique at 75%+ is still teachable. |
| 🟢 Bodyweight | Advanced calisthenics at Strength loads: weighted pull-ups, weighted dips, ring work. No barbell. |
| 🔵 Structured | The classic Strength format. 5×5, 4×4, 3×3. Progressive overload tracked precisely. |
| 🟣 Technical | Precision Strength: fewer sets, longer rest, perfect execution at 80–85%. |
| 🔴 Intense | High-volume Strength: more sets, abbreviated rest (still 2+ min), higher fatigue. |
| 🟠 | Invalid for pure Strength (barbells excluded from Circuit) |
| 🟡 Fun | Variety in Strength: new movements at working loads, unconventional implements. |
| ⚪ Mindful | Slow-tempo Strength: 5-count eccentric at 75%, extended rest. Tension awareness at high load. |

#### Common Strength Errors

- **Rest theft:** Cutting rest to 90 seconds "to keep moving." This converts the session to metabolic work, not neural adaptation. The 3–4 minute rest is the mechanism.
- **Rep creep:** Adding a 7th rep "because the weight felt light." If the ceiling is 6, stop at 6. The session is programmed to a stimulus, not to failure.
- **Wrong primary work:** Using isolation movements as 🧈 in Strength. Bicep curls at 80% don't produce neural adaptation in the relevant patterns.
- **No ▶️ Primer:** Jumping from warm-up to 80% without CNS activation. PAP (post-activation potentiation) is real. Skip the primer and the working sets suffer.

---

### 🦋 Hypertrophy

**Load:** 65–75% 1RM
**Reps:** 8–12
**Rest:** 60–90 seconds
**Max Difficulty:** 3/5
**CNS Demand:** Moderate

#### Character

Muscle growth through volume and metabolic stress. Load is a tool for creating tension — not the goal itself. The pump matters. The burn matters. Mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage are all valid mechanisms and 🦋 uses all three.

The distinction from ⛽: the CNS is not the target. The muscle tissue is. Shorter rest, more volume, higher rep ranges, more exercises, more sets. The athlete should feel the work in the muscle, not just in the bar.

#### What Hypertrophy Is Not

- Not strength training with lighter weight. Different adaptation target.
- Not appearance work (that's 🌹 Aesthetic Axis). Hypertrophy can be done with any Axis character.
- Not circuit training. The rest, though shorter than Strength, is still 60–90 seconds. Not 20 seconds.
- Not endurance. 12 reps is the ceiling, not the default.

#### Block Sequence

```
♨️ → ▶️ → 🧈 → 🗿 → 🪞/🧩 → 🪫 → 🚂 → 🧮
```

- ♨️ Warm-Up: blood flow emphasis, pump primers, tissue prep
- ▶️ Primer: activation sets at 50–60%, brief
- 🧈 Bread & Butter: primary compound(s) at 65–75%; 3–4 sets × 8–12 reps
- 🗿 Sculpt: hypertrophy shaping at specific angles; 3 × 10–15
- 🪞 Vanity or 🧩 Supplemental: pump/isolation work or supporting accessory
- 🪫 Release: transition; short stretching and flush-out
- 🚂 Junction + 🧮 SAVE

#### Volume Landmarks (Hypertrophy)

Research context for the middle-math layer: effective volume sits between Minimum Effective Volume (MEV) and Maximum Recoverable Volume (MRV). The operative zone for most athletes:
- Upper body pushing: 10–20 sets per week per muscle group
- Upper body pulling: 10–20 sets per week per muscle group
- Legs: 12–24 sets per week
- Isolation muscles: 8–15 sets per week

Individual cards don't track weekly totals — that's the user's history layer. But each Hypertrophy card should generate enough volume to count as a meaningful training stimulus (≥3 sets of the primary movement).

#### Exercise Selection (Hypertrophy filter)

- Compound primary movement in 🧈, isolation work in 🗿/🪞
- Full ROM mandatory for growth stimulus — partial reps don't count
- Cable and machine work valid and often superior (constant tension)
- Mind-muscle connection cues appropriate here; clinical jargon is not
- Difficulty cap 3/5: no extreme pauses, no deficit work requiring 4/5 skill

#### Hypertrophy × Axis Interactions

| Axis | Hypertrophy Expression |
|------|----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Classic bodybuilding splits: bench + rows + accessories. Volume-focused bilateral compounds. |
| 🔨 Functional | Functional hypertrophy: single-leg press, landmine work, carries with volume focus. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Isolation-heavy hypertrophy: cable work, machine work, isolation-compound-isolation structure. |
| 🪐 Challenge | Challenging hypertrophy variations: paused reps, tempo sets, bands for accommodating resistance. |
| ⌛ Time | Density hypertrophy: AMRAP blocks, timed sets, accumulated reps. |
| 🐬 Partner | Forced reps, drop sets with partner unloading, alternating sets for higher frequency. |

#### Common Hypertrophy Errors

- **Load confusion:** Training at 80% with 5 reps and calling it Hypertrophy. It's Strength. The rep range is the marker.
- **Rest shortchanging:** 30-second rest in 🦋 makes it metabolic conditioning, not hypertrophy. 60–90 seconds minimum.
- **Skipping 🗿:** The sculpt block adds the secondary angles that make Hypertrophy comprehensive. Without it, the session trains one pattern repeatedly.
- **No 🪫:** Hypertrophy generates significant metabolic fatigue. The release block is the transition back; skipping it leaves the athlete in a physiologically activated state.

---

### 🏟 Performance

**Load:** 85–100%+ 1RM
**Reps:** 1–3
**Rest:** Full (athlete-determined)
**Max Difficulty:** 5/5
**CNS Demand:** High

#### Character

Testing, not training. You test, you record, and you leave. No junk volume after the test. 🏟 blocks hypertrophy-style accumulation by default.

Performance is the assessment moment in the training cycle. It exists to answer: where are we? What can this athlete actually do right now? The answer requires maximal expression — and maximal expression requires complete freshness. Adding supplemental work after a test contaminates the data and exceeds the athlete's recovery capacity.

**Scope of 🏟 Performance:**
- Strength benchmarks (1RM, 3RM testing)
- Conditioning benchmarks (time trials, max rep tests)
- Movement assessments
- Sport-specific performance tests

#### What Performance Is Not

- Not a hard training day. It is an assessment day.
- Not an opportunity to add "just a little extra." There is no little extra after a max effort.
- Not applicable to beginners on a new movement. 🐂 Foundation must precede 🏟.
- Not 🔴 Intense. High intensity ≠ high volume.

#### Block Sequence (3–4 blocks only — no exceptions)

```
♨️ → 🪜 → 🧈 → 🚂 → 🧮
```

- ♨️ Warm-Up: efficient; just enough to reach working temperature and movement fluency
- 🪜 Progression: the essential ramp to the test; e.g., 50%×5 → 65%×3 → 75%×2 → 85%×1 → 90%×1 → test
- 🧈 Bread & Butter: the test itself; 1–3 attempts with full rest between; record the result
- 🚂 Junction + 🧮 SAVE

**No 🧩, no 🗿, no 🪞, no 🌋, no supplemental work of any kind.** Test. Record. Leave.

#### Progressive Ramp Protocol (Performance)

The ramp in 🪜 is not warm-up sets — it is structured approach sets that prime the CNS for maximum output without creating fatigue:
- Each step increases load and decreases reps
- Rest between steps: 2–3 minutes
- Final step before test: 90%+ of test weight for 1 rep, 3+ min rest, then test
- The ramp informs the test attempt — if a step feels wrong, revise the test target

#### Exercise Selection (Performance filter)

- Only exercises for which the athlete has an established training baseline
- No new movements at test weight — 🐂 Foundation must precede any 🏟 test
- GOLD exercises (Olympic lifts, advanced plyometrics) valid if the athlete has competence AND Color is 🔴 or 🟣
- Difficulty 5/5 is valid — but only for movements the athlete has trained

#### Performance × Axis Interactions

| Axis | Performance Expression |
|------|----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | The classic test: 1RM squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press. |
| 🔨 Functional | Athletic performance tests: max broad jump, sprint time trial, max single-leg work. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Maximum effort isolation test: max reps at bodyweight, peak contraction assessment. |
| 🪐 Challenge | The hardest variation the athlete trains, tested to maximum. |
| ⌛ Time | Time-based tests: 500m row, mile run, max reps in 5 minutes. |
| 🐬 Partner | Partner-tested maximums: spotting enables true 1RM attempts on bench/squat. |

#### Common Performance Errors

- **The supplemental urge:** Adding work after the test. This is always wrong. The test is the session. Anything after contaminates recovery and violates the Order.
- **Under-ramping:** Skipping 🪜 and jumping to the test. Injury risk + suboptimal performance. The ramp is not optional.
- **Over-ramping:** So many approach sets that fatigue accumulates before the test. The ramp should prime, not exhaust.
- **Wrong block count:** Any Performance card with more than 4 blocks is invalid.

---

### 🌾 Full Body

**Load:** ~70% 1RM
**Reps:** 8–10
**Rest:** 30–90 seconds
**Max Difficulty:** 3/5
**CNS Demand:** Moderate

#### Character

Integration. Movements must flow into each other as one unified pattern. Full Body is not a superset and not a sequence of exercises done back-to-back. It is a unified movement — a complex or flow — that works the body as an integrated system.

**The mandatory tests:**

**Flow Test:** Does one movement flow into the next without a reset? If the athlete needs to stop, adjust their position, re-grip, or think about transition — it does not pass.

**Unity Test:** Is the result a single unified pattern, not a sequence of movements? A thruster is one movement: the squat drives directly into the overhead press. A squat followed by a row (where the athlete stands up, picks up a different implement, and begins rowing) fails. The pattern must be continuous.

**Both tests must pass. No exceptions.**

#### What Full Body Is Not

- Not a superset. A superset has two separate exercises with rest between. Full Body has a unified flowing pattern.
- Not a conditioning circuit. 🟠 Circuit is for circuits. 🌾 Full Body is for integrated patterns.
- Not "doing squats and bench in the same session." That is a combined day, not a Full Body protocol.

#### Block Sequence

```
♨️ → 🎼 → 🧈 → 🧩 → 🪫 → 🚂 → 🧮
```

- ♨️ Warm-Up: integrative movement previewing the unified pattern
- 🎼 Composition: the arrangement logic; describes the unified pattern before listing exercises
- 🧈 Bread & Butter: the primary integrated complex at 70%; must pass Flow and Unity tests
- 🧩 Supplemental: additional integrated patterns supporting the main one; also must flow
- 🪫 Release: transition; stretching and movement work
- 🚂 Junction + 🧮 SAVE

#### Exercise Selection (Full Body filter)

- Movements that transition naturally: thruster (squat → press), deadlift + shrug, clean + front squat
- Movements at the same implement that flow: barbell complex, dumbbell complex, kettlebell flow
- Must train multiple muscle groups through multiple planes
- No two-implement complexes where the athlete changes equipment mid-movement (breaks flow)

#### Full Body × Axis Interactions

| Axis | Full Body Expression |
|------|---------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Barbell complexes. Power clean to front squat. Deadlift to Romanian deadlift to row. Classic flows. |
| 🔨 Functional | Unilateral flows. Single-arm clean + press + lunge. Athletic transfer complexes. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | Cable and machine flows. Cable pull + rotation + press. Full-body pump with aesthetic lens. |
| 🪐 Challenge | Advanced integrated patterns. Man-maker. Turkish get-up. Flows that challenge movement quality. |
| ⌛ Time | AMRAP full-body complexes. EMOM integrated patterns. Time structures applied to unified flows. |
| 🐬 Partner | Partner integrated drills. Synchronized flows. Partner medicine ball exchange complexes. |

#### Common Full Body Errors

- **Superset mislabeling:** Writing two exercises alternated and calling it Full Body. If there's a reset between, it's a superset.
- **Circuit mislabeling:** Writing 5 stations rotated and calling it Full Body. If each station is separate, it's a circuit.
- **Failing the Flow Test:** The most common error. The athlete performs movement A, stops completely, then begins movement B. This fails.
- **Failing the Unity Test:** A sequence that is technically continuous but produces no unified pattern — just exercises done quickly. If you would call it a superset in conversation, it fails.

---

### ⚖ Balance

**Load:** ~70% 1RM
**Reps:** 10–12
**Rest:** 90 seconds
**Max Difficulty:** 3/5
**CNS Demand:** Moderate

#### Character

Correction. The microscope on weak links and asymmetries. ⚖ Balance sessions target specific gaps in the athlete's physical profile — not general conditioning, not general strength, but the identifiable weaknesses that limit overall development.

The Type dimension specifies which gap is targeted:
- ⚖🛒 Push gap: triceps, side delts, front delts
- ⚖🪡 Pull gap: biceps, rear delts, forearms, grip
- ⚖🍗 Leg gap: calves, adductors, tibialis anterior
- ⚖➕ Plus gap: rotational stability, anti-rotation, core integration
- ⚖➖ Ultra gap: energy system gaps, aerobic base

#### What Balance Is Not

- Not a general accessory day. The work is corrective and targeted.
- Not a weak day. Balance sessions train directly toward specific deficits.
- Not arbitrary. The exercises must address the identified gap.

#### Block Sequence

```
♨️ → 🏗 → 🧈 → 🧩 → 🪫 → 🚂 → 🧮
```

- ♨️ Warm-Up: mobility targeting the session's gap; corrective mobility
- 🏗 Reformance: prehab and corrective work that addresses the structural root of the imbalance
- 🧈 Bread & Butter: targeted accessory compounds that directly address the gap
- 🧩 Supplemental: supporting corrective work at different angles
- 🪫 Release: gentle tissue work for the targeted area
- 🚂 Junction + 🧮 SAVE

#### Exercise Selection (Balance filter)

- Exercises must directly target the identified gap in the Type × Axis combination
- Isolation work is valid and often preferred — the deficit is specific
- Unilateral work often reveals asymmetries more clearly than bilateral
- Difficulty cap 3/5 — the athlete is working a weakness, not testing a strength

#### Common Balance Errors

- **Generic accessory:** Writing a general accessory session with non-corrective exercises. The work must target the specific gap named by the Type.
- **Wrong Type routing:** ⚖🛒 is triceps, side delts, front delts — not chest. The Push gap targets the weakest elements of the push chain, not the primary movers.
- **Too heavy:** 70% is the approximate load. The goal is muscular development and correction, not neural adaptation. Higher load belongs in ⛽.

---

### 🖼 Restoration

**Load:** ≤55% 1RM
**Reps:** 12–15
**Rest:** 60 seconds
**Max Difficulty:** 2/5
**CNS Demand:** Low

#### Character

Recovery without training debt. The athlete leaves the session fresher than they entered. Not rest — active recovery. Not easy training — the specific mode of work designed to restore the system rather than challenge it further.

**Extended scope of 🖼 Restoration:**
- Somatic movement
- TRE (tension and trauma releasing exercises)
- Pelvic floor work
- Deep hip work
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Nervous system regulation
- Gentle mobility and tissue work

🖼 + 🌹 + ⚪ is the deepest recovery lane in the system. The 🌹 Aesthetic Axis turns inward in Restoration context — instead of isolation work for appearance, the lens becomes somatic: pelvic floor, psoas, diaphragm, deep hip structures.

#### What Restoration Is Not

- Not a rest day. Rest days have no workout. 🖼 is an active session with structure.
- Not a warm-up. It is a complete session.
- Not easy strength training. The load ceiling (55%) and difficulty cap (2/5) make this distinct.
- Not a place for GOLD exercises, AMRAP blocks, 🌋 Gutter, or any intensity work.

#### Block Sequence

```
🎯 → 🪫 → 🧈 → 🧬 → 🚂 → 🧮
```

Note: 🖼 Restoration opens with 🎯 Intention (not ♨️ Warm-Up). The intention frames the somatic work that follows.

- 🎯 Intention: one sentence; somatic, reflective, inward framing
- 🪫 Release: early release; gentle movement to begin parasympathetic activation
- 🧈 Bread & Butter: the main somatic or mobility sequence; not a lift
- 🧬 Imprint: gentle pattern repetition at minimal load; locking in rest state
- 🚂 Junction + 🧮 SAVE

#### Exercise Selection (Restoration filter)

- No GOLD exercises (gated by Color AND incompatible with difficulty ceiling)
- No barbells (not a Color rule — a spirit-of-Order rule; sub-55% barbell work is pointless for restoration)
- Somatic work: breathing exercises, pelvic floor, diaphragm, psoas, hip capsule
- Gentle loaded work: light dumbbell or bodyweight mobility, yoga-adjacent movements
- Recovery modalities: static stretching, foam rolling, contrast work

#### Restoration × Axis Interactions

| Axis | Restoration Expression |
|------|----------------------|
| 🏛 Basics | Foundational recovery: hip flexor release, thoracic mobility, shoulder restoration. Classic maintenance work. |
| 🔨 Functional | Somatic movement therapy: TRE, unloaded carries for body scanning, flow states. |
| 🌹 Aesthetic | The somatic lens: pelvic floor, diaphragm, psoas, deep hip structures. Not cable curls. |
| 🪐 Challenge | Challenging restoration: advanced yoga postures, deep hip work, fascial release patterns. |
| ⌛ Time | Timed holds, breath cycles, meditative movement sequences. |
| 🐬 Partner | Assisted stretching, PNF with partner, restoration pair work. |

#### The 🌹 Somatic Rule (Critical)

In 🖼 Restoration context, the 🌹 Aesthetic Axis does NOT produce isolation pump work. The axis turns inward. The "aesthetic" lens in restoration becomes somatic — beauty is now felt, not seen. Work in 🖼🌹 addresses:
- Pelvic floor engagement and release
- Psoas lengthening and activation
- Diaphragmatic breathing patterns
- Deep hip capsule mobility
- Fascial release sequences

**Do not assign cable curls to 🖼🌹. This is one of the most common generation errors.**

#### Common Restoration Errors

- **Load creep:** Training at 60%+ and calling it Restoration. The ceiling is 55%.
- **Wrong 🌹 content:** Isolation pump work in 🖼🌹. See The 🌹 Somatic Rule above.
- **Adding intensity blocks:** 🌋 Gutter is hard-excluded. Any intensity work violates the Order.
- **Missing 🎯 Intention:** Restoration opens with 🎯. Without it, the somatic framing is absent and the session loses its recovery character.
- **Wrong ♨️ opening:** Restoration doesn't open with ♨️ Warm-Up — it opens with 🎯 Intention. The intention is the on-ramp.

## Order × Block Exclusion Matrix

Some blocks are hard-excluded under specific Orders. These are not preferences — they are system rules.

| Block | Hard-excluded from | Reason |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| 🌋 Gutter | 🖼 🐂 ⚪ | Intensity incompatible with recovery/foundation/mindful intent |
| 🧩 Supplemental (post-test) | 🏟 | Junk volume after test violates Performance principle |
| 🗿 Sculpt | 🏟 🖼 | Aesthetic shaping incompatible with test or restoration |
| 🪞 Vanity | 🏟 🖼 | Pump work incompatible with test or restoration |
| 🎱 ARAM | Any non-🟠 session | Circuit logic requires Circuit Color |
| 🎯 Intention (as opener) | Non-🖼 sessions | 🖼 uniquely opens with Intention |

---

## Order × Difficulty Scale

The 5-point difficulty scale maps to exercise complexity and load:

| Level | Definition | Examples |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1/5 | Minimal skill requirement. Bodyweight or unloaded. | Walking, light stretching, breathing |
| 2/5 | Basic movement patterns. Sub-maximal load. | Goblet squat, dumbbell row, push-up |
| 3/5 | Intermediate patterns. Moderate load. Established technique required. | Barbell squat, barbell bench, pull-up |
| 4/5 | Advanced technique. High load. Significant competence required. | Heavy deadlift, competition-stance work, paused squat |
| 5/5 | Expert-level skill or maximum load. GOLD-gated. | Olympic lifts at heavy loads, 1RM attempts, advanced plyometrics |

Order difficulty ceilings:
- 🐂 Foundation: 2/5
- ⛽ Strength: 4/5
- 🦋 Hypertrophy: 3/5
- 🏟 Performance: 5/5
- 🌾 Full Body: 3/5
- ⚖ Balance: 3/5
- 🖼 Restoration: 2/5
