# PPL± Vocabulary Standard

This document formalizes the language standard for all PPL± content: workout cards, the Operis, README files, whiteboard entries, cosmograms, and any content that carries the PPL± voice.

The publication-standard.md establishes the tonal register and historical inheritance. This document is its companion — a reference list of banned words, preferred verbs, and the factual register standard that governs every claim made in PPL± content.

## The Voice, Restated

The voice is the building's voice. Measured, technical, human, neutral. It speaks to a competent adult who does not need to be managed. It is readable by a literate teenager and a retired architect in the same edition without either cringing.

The voice does not perform enthusiasm. It does not coach through encouragement. It reports, specifies, observes, and names. It earns warmth through attention, not adjectives.

## Banned Words and Replacements

These words are prohibited across all PPL± content. If a draft contains one, replace it or delete the sentence.

| Banned | Reason | Replacement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| optimize | Fitness-industry filler. Implies engineering what should be trained. | Be specific: "reduce rest," "increase load," "improve consistency" |
| unlock | App-store language. Patronizing. | Delete or rewrite |
| level up | Gaming metaphor. Patronizing. | "progress," "advance," "build" |
| crush it | Motivational filler. | Delete the sentence |
| let's go | Motivational filler. | Delete the sentence |
| journey (training context) | Spiritual-wellness register. | "progression," "process," "career" |
| mindset | Self-help register. Vague. | "approach," "attitude," "method" |
| game-changer | Hyperbole. Always false. | Delete or use a specific claim |
| hack | Tech-bro register. | Delete or rewrite |
| synergy | Corporate register. | Delete or rewrite with specific mechanism |
| holistic | Wellness-marketing filler. | "complete," or name the specific components |
| paradigm | Philosophical weight without philosophical content. | Banned unless genuine philosophy is present |
| empower | Condescending. Implies the reader lacked power. | Delete or rewrite |
| transform your body | Marketing language. | Name the specific adaptation |
| integration (for merged training streams) | Ambiguous and overused. | "culmination," or describe the specific merger |

## Fitness-Register Prohibitions

These phrases belong to the fitness-influencer register. They are banned regardless of context.

- "gains" (as noun, casual fitness meaning)
- "beast mode"
- "smash [a workout]"
- "shred" (body composition context)
- "tone" (as training verb — anatomically imprecise)
- "feel the burn"
- "push through"
- "no excuses"
- "earned [a meal/rest]"
- "listen to your body" (acceptable in clinical context; banned as motivational filler)
- "functional fitness" (redundant; all training has function)

---

## YouTube Thumbnail / Dopamine-Design Prohibitions

These are structure and formatting prohibitions, not word-level bans.

- No exclamation-heavy headers ("THIS CHANGED EVERYTHING!")
- No emoji-stuffed sentences (emojis are section markers and address notation, not decoration)
- No hype cadence (short punchy line / short punchy line / payoff) unless the content genuinely warrants it
- No clickbait framing ("The ONE exercise you're missing" / "Why everything you know is wrong")
- No generational signaling ("For Gen Z" / "Old school" as framing)

---

- observe

## The Factual Register

Every claim about exercise, anatomy, or training effect must be traceable to exercise science. The standard is a good textbook written warmly — not a peer-reviewed abstract, but nothing a peer reviewer would contradict.

**Examples**:

Acceptable: "The Romanian deadlift loads the posterior chain through hip extension under an eccentric stretch of the hamstrings."

Banned: "The Romanian deadlift transforms your backside."

Acceptable: "Five sets of five at 80% builds force production through high-threshold motor unit recruitment."

Banned: "Five sets of five optimizes neuromuscular recruitment."

Acceptable: "The latissimus dorsi is the primary mover in vertical pulling. It originates at the thoracolumbar fascia and inserts at the intertubercular groove of the humerus."

Banned: "Pull training builds that V-taper."

The anatomical claim should name what is working and how, not what it looks like or what it does for appearance. Appearance references belong in 🌹 Aesthetic content and 🪞 Vanity blocks — and even there, the language is honest and specific, not aspirational.

## Tonal Prohibitions

These are categorical prohibitions, not word-level bans. Any content that falls into one of these categories fails regardless of the specific words used.

**Motivational filler**: Content whose purpose is to make the reader feel good rather than to convey useful information. The test: if the sentence were deleted, would the reader lose any information? If no, delete it.

**Clinical jargon**: Anatomical terms deployed to sound authoritative rather than to convey precision. If a phrase like "activate the posterior kinetic chain" could be replaced with "extend at the hip" without loss of meaning, replace it.

**Spiritual-wellness register**: Any language that implies training is a path to self-discovery, inner peace, or transformation of the self. Training adapts tissue. It does not transform identity.

**Patronizing framing**: Content that addresses the reader as if they need to be managed, encouraged, or protected from the difficulty of the work. The reader is a competent adult. Treat them accordingly.

**AI-generated list cadence**: Bullet-point lists that substitute enumeration for thought. A list is appropriate when the content is genuinely enumerable. It is not appropriate as a substitute for prose that would require thinking.

## The Newspaper Test

Before publishing any sentence, ask: would a copy editor at a serious newspaper let this through?

The copy editor's standard:
- Is every claim supported by a fact?
- Does every sentence say one thing?
- Is there any word that could be cut without losing meaning?
- Would the sentence embarrass the publication if read aloud?

If any answer points to a problem, revise.

---

## Application Scope

This standard applies to:

- Workout card content (🎯 Intention, block descriptions, cues, 🚂 Junction rationale, 🧮 SAVE closing principles)
- Operis editions (all departments)
- README files and CLAUDE.md updates
- Whiteboard entries (loosen for speed, tighten before commit)
- Cosmogram research documents
- Wilson Note (the building's voice — highest standard)
- Deck identity documents
- Any content that will appear in the experience layer

It does not apply to:
- Frontmatter YAML (technical metadata, not prose)
- Code comments in scripts (technical register, different standard)
- Session planning and scratchpad notes on the whiteboard

## Companion Document

`scl-deep/publication-standard.md` establishes the three-register inheritance (1830s departmental architecture, 1920s grammatical economy, 2026 mobile scroll register) and the 1,680-editor editorial model. Read that document first. This vocabulary standard is the operational reference for day-to-day writing.

When in doubt about register, return to the building metaphor: the voice is the building's voice. The building does not perform. It stands. It accommodates. It measures. It endures.
