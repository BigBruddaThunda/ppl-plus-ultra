# Deck 08 Identity — ⛽🔨 Strength Functional

## 1) Deck Philosophy
Deck 08 is unilateral strength under real-world constraints. These sessions sit in the 75–85% strength range, but they avoid bilateral comfort patterns and ask the athlete to produce force with one side leading from standing, split stance, single-leg, and offset positions.

This deck is where asymmetry is measured and corrected. Every session should make side-to-side differences obvious in load, control, and fatigue tolerance. Logging each side is mandatory, and the training intent is transfer: carry, press, pull, squat, hinge, and condition in ways that hold up outside fixed gym positions.

Deck 08 is not 🏛 bilateral classic lifting and not 🌹 isolation-first physique work. It is practical unilateral force production with athletic posture, anti-rotation demand, and repeatable progression.

## 3) Color Differentiation Logic

- **⚫ Teaching:** Deck 08 teaching sessions slow unilateral setup down so stance, rib position, and contralateral brace are coached before heavy loading. Exercise choice favors controllable patterns where error correction is visible rep to rep.
- **🟢 Bodyweight:** Bodyweight functional strength uses unilateral calisthenics progressions (pistol, archer push-up, crawls, single-leg bridges) to prove gym strength transfers without machines or racks. Selection excludes fixed-path work and prioritizes positional ownership.
- **🔵 Structured:** Structured cards use the most repeatable unilateral lifts and interval formats so the logbook drives progression. Exercise selection prioritizes clean comparability week to week.
- **🟣 Technical:** Technical cards narrow exercise count and choose precision-biased unilateral movements (landmine, get-up, half-kneeling cable, cadence control). Rest is longer and misses are technical, not metabolic.
- **🔴 Intense:** Intense cards choose unilateral exercises that can safely absorb fatigue in supersets and denser blocks. Movements needing maximal coordination under low fatigue are filtered out.
- **🟠 Circuit:** Circuit cards rotate stations across tissues and movement patterns with no barbell dependency. Exercise selection is loop-safe and alternates stress to keep quality in timed rotations.
- **🟡 Fun:** Fun cards expand unilateral vocabulary with less common patterns and grip/plane variation while still respecting Strength order ceilings. The goal is exposure without randomness.
- **⚪ Mindful:** Mindful cards enforce 4-second eccentrics, pauses, and breath pacing on unilateral patterns that improve proprioception and stability. Exercise choice favors controllable tension over maximal output.
