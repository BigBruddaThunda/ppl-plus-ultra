# Deck 07 Identity — ⛽🏛 Strength Basics

## 1) Deck Philosophy

Deck 07 is bilateral barbell strength at 75–85%. These sessions exist at the foundation of the entire training system — the proven classics, the movements that have built real strength for decades, executed heavy, with full recovery between sets. This is not the deck for novelty. It is the deck for mastery.

⛽🏛 = compound barbell force production. Back squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press. Bilateral loading, stable platforms, time-tested patterns. The Axis is 🏛 Basics — barbell first, bilateral first, classic first. The Order is ⛽ Strength — 75–85% of 1RM, 4–6 reps, 3–4 minutes full recovery, high CNS demand.

This deck is where the athlete finds out if they are strong. Not functional, not aesthetic, not athletic — strong. Load numbers tell the story. Everything else is context.

Deck 07 is not 🔨 Functional unilateral work and not 🌹 Aesthetic isolation. It is heavy bilateral compound force — the same patterns repeated across 40 Color variations, each variation revealing a different angle of the same underlying question: how much can you produce, and can you repeat it?

## 3) Color Differentiation Logic

- **⚫ Teaching:** Deck 07 teaching sessions slow each classic lift down and install the coaching conversation — bar path, bracing sequence, foot pressure, breath timing. Volume is secondary to comprehension. Exercise selection stays with the most coachable version of each bilateral pattern.
- **🟢 Bodyweight:** Bodyweight basics sessions ask whether the strength built under a barbell transfers when the bar is gone. Advanced calisthenics apply: weighted dips, pistol squats, hanging leg raises, L-sits. Equipment tier drops to 0–2 but the ⛽ Strength ceiling remains.
- **🔵 Structured:** Structured sessions use the second great bilateral classic in each Type — OHP alongside bench, bent-over row alongside deadlift, front squat alongside back squat, push press alongside clean. Logged, repeatable, benchmarkable. Run the same session every 4–6 weeks and let the numbers tell the story.
- **🟣 Technical:** Technical sessions narrow to the highest-precision movement in each Type — Board Press, Rack Pull, Pause Squat, Power Clean, 1000m rowing technical audit. Less volume, full rest, every rep examined. 🟣 unlocks GOLD exercises.
- **🔴 Intense:** Intense sessions use the complementary bilateral movement at high volume with reduced rest — Incline Press, Sumo Deadlift, Romanian Deadlift, Power Clean Complex. Exercise changes distribute load across the training week, not just intensity. 🔴 unlocks GOLD exercises.
- **🟠 Circuit:** Circuit sessions remove barbells entirely and apply tissue-rotation loop logic. Each station works a different tissue so the previous one recovers. Push-Ups, Pull-Ups, Goblet Squats, Kettlebell Swings. The engine runs continuously.
- **🟡 Fun:** Fun sessions introduce angle, implement, and movement variation within the 🏛 Basics framework — Decline Press, T-Bar Row, Bulgarian Split Squat, Dumbbell Thruster. Different patterns, same heavyweight intent. No vibe-speak.
- **⚪ Mindful:** Mindful sessions apply 4-second eccentrics and breath pacing to the bilateral classics — Floor Press, Romanian Deadlift, Hip Thrust, Front Squat with pause. The adaptation is positional awareness under load, not max output.
