# Deck Naming Convention

**Template:** `[Primary Movement or Equipment+Exercise] — [Target Muscle/Focus, Context Modifier]`

Left side names what the athlete is doing with ExRx-style exercise language.
Right side names where it lands and why this variant exists in the Color context.

## Hard Rules
1. No title starts with "The".
2. Banned words: Protocol, Prescription, Program, System, Routine, Regimen, Blueprint, Formula, Method.
3. No vibe-speak titles (Full Send, Playground, Dial It In, etc.).
4. Group text test: title must tell a client body part + task.
5. Grandparent test: title must be immediately understandable.
6. ExRx editorial order: Equipment → Variation/Position → Exercise → Muscle/Focus.
7. Within one Type row, all 8 Color variants must use different primary exercises.
8. Keep language high-school reading level and textbook-clear.
