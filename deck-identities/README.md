# Deck Identities

Deck identity documents are the vision layer between SCL constraints and card writing.
They define how a deck differentiates its 40 zip codes so generation has explicit direction before drafting session content.

All 42 decks will eventually have one identity file; Deck 08 is the pilot implementation.

See naming rules: [naming-convention.md](./naming-convention.md).
