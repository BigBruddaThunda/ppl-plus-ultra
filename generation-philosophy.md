# generation-philosophy.md — PPL± Generation v2

Six principles that govern how workouts are written in this system.
These override any tendency toward verbosity, fake precision, or template-filling.
Read this before generating any card.

## 1. Density Principle

A workout's exercise count and set count should fit its zip code naturally.

The zip code implies a workload. Don't pad it. Don't compress it into a checklist. Let it breathe at its natural size.

| Order | Exercises | Working Sets | Session Time |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| 🐂 Foundation | 3–4 | 12–16 | 40–50 min |
| ⛽ Strength | 2–3 | 10–15 | 50–65 min |
| 🦋 Hypertrophy | 4–5 | 16–22 | 50–65 min |
| 🏟 Performance | 1–2 | 3–8 | 25–40 min |
| 🌾 Full Body | 3–4 | 12–16 | 40–55 min |
| ⚖ Balance | 3–5 | 14–18 | 45–55 min |
| 🖼 Restoration | 2–3 | 8–12 | 30–45 min |

⛽ Strength Basics might be 2 exercises, 12 working sets, done in 55 minutes. That is a complete session.
🏟 Performance is 1–2 exercises. Test. Record. Leave. Nothing else.
🦋 Hypertrophy Aesthetic might be 5 exercises, 20 sets. That is appropriate.

Filling blocks because they exist is not generation. It is padding.

## 2. Text Message Principle

The workout should read like a knowledgeable trainer sent it to you. Short. Direct.

One or two cues per exercise, max. If the exercise name is clear, no cue is needed.

**Wrong:**
```
10 Barbell Bench Press (bar to lower sternum, elbows at 45°, feet drive into the floor,
arch maintained throughout, retract shoulder blades before unracking, breathe in on the way
down, breathe out as you press)
```

**Right:**
```
Bench Press — 4 × 5 at 80%
bar to lower sternum, full drive
```

Do not parenthesize every rep. Do not coach every breath. The person reading this has done a bench press before. The ⚫ Teaching color is the one that explains more. Every other color explains less.

When a cue is needed, it should be 3–6 words. Conversational. Specific.
- "hips back, not down"
- "bar to lower sternum"
- "head through the window"
- "full lockout, every rep"

If you are writing cues for things that are obvious, stop.

## 3. Junction Web Principle

Every zip code exists in a relational field. The card should be designed knowing what came before it and what comes after it.

The day-of-week Order mapping:

| Day | Order | Design Implication |
|-----|-------|--------------------|
| Monday | 🐂 Foundation | Body is fresh after Sunday rest. Foundation can be a real session, not just a warmup day. |
| Tuesday | ⛽ Strength | Low CNS from Monday 🐂. Wednesday 🦋 volume is coming. This is the week's heaviest day. Commit fully. Brief and intense. |
| Wednesday | 🦋 Hypertrophy | Neurally taxed from Tuesday ⛽. Don't go heavy. Go wide. Volume at moderate load. |
| Thursday | 🏟 Performance | Volume from Wednesday filled the tank. Today empties it into one effort. Test. Leave. |
| Friday | 🌾 Full Body | High CNS from Thursday's test. Integration, not intensity. Flow, not force. |
| Saturday | ⚖ Balance | Correction day. Weekend allows fine-tuning with rest on both sides. |
| Sunday | 🖼 Restoration | The lightest day. True recovery. Leave fresher than you arrived. |

The rolling 5-day Type cycle means adjacent days hit different muscle groups. Monday isn't always Push — the Type rotates independently of the day. A card can assume yesterday's muscles are not today's muscles.

This means:
- Volume on heavy days can be lower because the system context is doing the work
- A card after a test day should be designed for a taxed body, not a fresh one
- Sunday 🖼 is not just a cool-down color — it closes the week's arc

Do not write text that says "because yesterday was heavy." Write cards that reflect it in the design.

## 4. LEGO Block Principle

Blocks snap in and do their job. The block emoji carries the meaning for someone who has used this system before.

♨️ Warm-Up can be: "5 min general movement, 2 ramp sets of the main lift."
🪫 Release can be: "Stretch what you worked. 5 minutes."
🚂 Junction is 1–3 follow-up zips and a logging space.
🧮 SAVE is 1–2 sentences.

The content inside a block should be proportional to the Color:
- ⚫ Teaching gets the most explanation. It exists to explain.
- 🔵 Structured gets clear prescription. Sets, loads, rest, logged.
- ⚪ Mindful gets breathing notes and slow-tempo detail.
- 🟡 Fun gets options and permission to explore.
- Every other color gets less. The block emoji is the instruction. Trust it.

Do not write three sub-sections inside ♨️ Warm-Up for a 🔴 Intense session. A person doing a 🔴 session knows how to warm up. Point them at the right tissue and let them handle it.

Do not write five timed stretches inside 🪫 Release for a standard session. That is the ⚪ level of detail. A 🔵 session gets: "stretch the chest and triceps, 5 minutes."

The block name is fixed. The content scales to the Color. Everything else is noise.

---

## 5. Percentage Honesty Principle

Stop prescribing fake precision. "Work up to a heavy 5" is more honest than "78% × 5, 80% × 5, 82% × 4, 82% × 4" when the person doesn't have a current tested max.

Use:
- Exact percentage ranges where 🔵 Structured or 🟣 Technical make that the point — it IS the prescription
- Feel-based language when honest: "heavy but controlled," "moderate," "RPE 7–8"
- Range-based language: "75–80%" not "77%"
- Verbal load descriptors: "work up to a challenging set of 4," "back off 10% for the secondary work"

The 🔵 Structured color is the one where exact percentages live. That is the Color's actual purpose — trackable, repeatable, logged. In 🔵, prescribe the numbers.

In every other color: use percentages when they genuinely help and feel language when they don't. Do not paste a 🔵-style percentage ladder into a 🟡 Fun session.

## 6. Color as Personality

The 8 Colors should produce 8 genuinely different workouts. Not the same workout with different headers. Not the same block structure with a note about tempo. Eight different personalities.

**What each Color actually feels like:**

⚪ Mindful — Quiet and spacious. Maybe it's just bench press, 5 sets, slow, breathe, leave. Extended rest. No noise. No extras. The session is calm from the first set.

🟡 Fun — Exploration and play. Pick from 3 exercises. Cycle through what sounds interesting. The constraint is still in effect; the pathway through it is open. The sandbox matters here.

🔴 Intense — Relentless. Higher volume, reduced rest, push into discomfort. The supplemental work is not optional. There is no coasting in this color.

⚫ Teaching — Slow. More explanation. Extra rest. Comprehension over exertion. This color talks you through what the other colors assume you already know.

🟣 Technical — Fewer blocks, longer rest, quality above all. One or two movements, done with precision. Extended setup, more coaching on bar path or positioning.

🟢 Bodyweight — No gym required. The strength standards transfer to what your body can do without equipment. Not easier — different.

🟠 Circuit — Station rotation with loop logic. Each station recovers what the previous station worked. Time-based, not set-based.

🔵 Structured — Trackable. Repeatable. The log is half the session. Numbers go in, numbers come out. Progress is measured.

The Color isn't a modifier on a template. It IS the template. Generate the card from the Color's personality first, then fill in the zip code constraints. Not the other way around.

## Anti-Patterns

These patterns appeared in v1 generation. They should not appear in v2.

**Over-cuing every rep:**
`10 Band Pull-Apart (arms locked, retract at the top, feel the squeeze, elbows slightly bent)` → `Band Pull-Apart × 10`

**Sub-block zip codes as required inline elements:**
`⛽🏛🛒🔵♨️ (Warm-Up | Chest/Shoulders/Triceps | Basics | Tier 2–3)` → Optional metadata, not required on every block

**Fake-precise percentage ladders:**
`Set 1: 72% × 4, Set 2: 76% × 3` in a non-🔵 context → "Work up to a heavy 5 over 2–3 sets"

**Templates applied uniformly across Colors:**
Same ♨️ structure, same 🧩 structure, same 🪫 structure regardless of Color → Color drives structure, not the other way around

**Coaching every obvious thing:**
`(bar to chest, elbows 45°)` on a standard bench press → Omit. The exercise name is the instruction.

**Excessive 🪫 and ♨️ detail in non-Teaching colors:**
Five timed stretches with breathing notes in a 🔴 card's release block → "Stretch what you worked."

## What v2 Cards Sound Like

The card should feel like a knowledgeable person wrote it down for someone they respect. The person reading it is competent. They don't need to be managed. They need to know what to do.

**v1 tone:**
> "The weight descends on your terms, not on its own. Four seconds down, every rep."

That's fine as intention framing. It gets into trouble when that level of narration bleeds into every block.

**v2 tone:**
The ⚪ Mindful card might just say: "4-second eccentric throughout. Bench press, 5 sets, 80%. Take your time. Log if the tempo held." That's the whole session, and it's right.

The 🔵 Structured card says: "Bench Press 4 × 5 at 78-82%. OHP 3 × 5 at 75-80%. Log every set." Done.

The 🟡 Fun card says: "Pick two presses you haven't done in a while. Same strength parameters. See what they feel like." That is a complete instruction.

The workout is the data. The words are the delivery mechanism. Get them to the gym and out of the way.
